    /// The `noop_method_call` lint detects specific calls to noop methods
    /// such as a calling `<&T as Clone>::clone` where `T: !Clone`.
    ///
    /// ### Example
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// # #![allow(unused)]
    /// #![warn(noop_method_call)]
    /// struct Foo;
    /// let foo = &Foo;
    /// let clone: &Foo = foo.clone();
    /// ```
    ///
    /// {{produces}}
    ///
    /// ### Explanation
    ///
    /// Some method calls are noops meaning that they do nothing. Usually such methods
    /// are the result of blanket implementations that happen to create some method invocations
    /// that end up not doing anything. For instance, `Clone` is implemented on all `&T`, but
    /// calling `clone` on a `&T` where `T` does not implement clone, actually doesn't do anything
    /// as references are copy. This lint detects these calls and warns the user about them.
