//! Nodes in the dependency graph.
//!
//! A node in the [dependency graph] is represented by a [`DepNode`].
//! A `DepNode` consists of a [`DepKind`] (which
//! specifies the kind of thing it represents, like a piece of HIR, MIR, etc.)
//! and a [`Fingerprint`], a 128-bit hash value, the exact meaning of which
//! depends on the node's `DepKind`. Together, the kind and the fingerprint
//! fully identify a dependency node, even across multiple compilation sessions.
//! In other words, the value of the fingerprint does not depend on anything
//! that is specific to a given compilation session, like an unpredictable
//! interning key (e.g., `NodeId`, `DefId`, `Symbol`) or the numeric value of a
//! pointer. The concept behind this could be compared to how git commit hashes
//! uniquely identify a given commit. The fingerprinting approach has
//! a few advantages:
//!
//! * A `DepNode` can simply be serialized to disk and loaded in another session
//!   without the need to do any "rebasing" (like we have to do for Spans and
//!   NodeIds) or "retracing" (like we had to do for `DefId` in earlier
//!   implementations of the dependency graph).
//! * A `Fingerprint` is just a bunch of bits, which allows `DepNode` to
//!   implement `Copy`, `Sync`, `Send`, `Freeze`, etc.
//! * Since we just have a bit pattern, `DepNode` can be mapped from disk into
//!   memory without any post-processing (e.g., "abomination-style" pointer
//!   reconstruction).
//! * Because a `DepNode` is self-contained, we can instantiate `DepNodes` that
//!   refer to things that do not exist anymore. In previous implementations
//!   `DepNode` contained a `DefId`. A `DepNode` referring to something that
//!   had been removed between the previous and the current compilation session
//!   could not be instantiated because the current compilation session
//!   contained no `DefId` for thing that had been removed.
//!
//! `DepNode` definition happens in the `define_dep_nodes!()` macro. This macro
//! defines the `DepKind` enum. Each `DepKind` has its own parameters that are
//! needed at runtime in order to construct a valid `DepNode` fingerprint.
//! However, only `CompileCodegenUnit` and `CompileMonoItem` are constructed
//! explicitly (with `make_compile_codegen_unit` cq `make_compile_mono_item`).
//!
//! Because the macro sees what parameters a given `DepKind` requires, it can
//! "infer" some properties for each kind of `DepNode`:
//!
//! * Whether a `DepNode` of a given kind has any parameters at all. Some
//!   `DepNode`s could represent global concepts with only one value.
//! * Whether it is possible, in principle, to reconstruct a query key from a
//!   given `DepNode`. Many `DepKind`s only require a single `DefId` parameter,
//!   in which case it is possible to map the node's fingerprint back to the
//!   `DefId` it was computed from. In other cases, too much information gets
//!   lost during fingerprint computation.
//!
//! `make_compile_codegen_unit` and `make_compile_mono_items`, together with
//! `DepNode::new()`, ensures that only valid `DepNode` instances can be
//! constructed. For example, the API does not allow for constructing
//! parameterless `DepNode`s with anything other than a zeroed out fingerprint.
//! More generally speaking, it relieves the user of the `DepNode` API of
//! having to know how to compute the expected fingerprint for a given set of
//! node parameters.
