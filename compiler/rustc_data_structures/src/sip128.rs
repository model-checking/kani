// # Implementation
//
// This implementation uses buffering to reduce the hashing cost for inputs
// consisting of many small integers. Buffering simplifies the integration of
// integer input--the integer write function typically just appends to the
// buffer with a statically sized write, updates metadata, and returns.
//
// Buffering also prevents alternating between writes that do and do not trigger
// the hashing process. Only when the entire buffer is full do we transition
// into hashing. This allows us to keep the hash state in registers for longer,
// instead of loading and storing it before and after processing each element.
//
// When a write fills the buffer, a buffer processing function is invoked to
// hash all of the buffered input. The buffer processing functions are marked
// `#[inline(never)]` so that they aren't inlined into the append functions,
// which ensures the more frequently called append functions remain inlineable
// and don't include register pushing/popping that would only be made necessary
// by inclusion of the complex buffer processing path which uses those
// registers.
//
// The buffer includes a "spill"--an extra element at the end--which simplifies
// the integer write buffer processing path. The value that fills the buffer can
// be written with a statically sized write that may spill over into the spill.
// After the buffer is processed, the part of the value that spilled over can be
// written from the spill to the beginning of the buffer with another statically
// sized write. This write may copy more bytes than actually spilled over, but
// we maintain the metadata such that any extra copied bytes will be ignored by
// subsequent processing. Due to the static sizes, this scheme performs better
// than copying the exact number of bytes needed into the end and beginning of
// the buffer.
//
// The buffer is uninitialized, which improves performance, but may preclude
// efficient implementation of alternative approaches. The improvement is not so
// large that an alternative approach should be disregarded because it cannot be
// efficiently implemented with an uninitialized buffer. On the other hand, an
// uninitialized buffer may become more important should a larger one be used.
//
// # Platform Dependence
//
// The SipHash algorithm operates on byte sequences. It parses the input stream
// as 8-byte little-endian integers. Therefore, given the same byte sequence, it
// produces the same result on big- and little-endian hardware.
//
// However, the Hasher trait has methods which operate on multi-byte integers.
// How they are converted into byte sequences can be endian-dependent (by using
// native byte order) or independent (by consistently using either LE or BE byte
// order). It can also be `isize` and `usize` size dependent (by using the
// native size), or independent (by converting to a common size), supposing the
// values can be represented in 32 bits.
//
// In order to make `SipHasher128` consistent with `SipHasher` in libstd, we
// choose to do the integer to byte sequence conversion in the platform-
// dependent way. Clients can achieve platform-independent hashing by widening
// `isize` and `usize` integers to 64 bits on 32-bit systems and byte-swapping
// integers on big-endian systems before passing them to the writing functions.
// This causes the input byte sequence to look identical on big- and little-
// endian systems (supposing `isize` and `usize` values can be represented in 32
// bits), which ensures platform-independent results.
