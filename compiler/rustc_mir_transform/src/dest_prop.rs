//! Propagates assignment destinations backwards in the CFG to eliminate redundant assignments.
//!
//! # Motivation
//!
//! MIR building can insert a lot of redundant copies, and Rust code in general often tends to move
//! values around a lot. The result is a lot of assignments of the form `dest = {move} src;` in MIR.
//! MIR building for constants in particular tends to create additional locals that are only used
//! inside a single block to shuffle a value around unnecessarily.
//!
//! LLVM by itself is not good enough at eliminating these redundant copies (eg. see
//! <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32966>), so this leaves some performance on the table
//! that we can regain by implementing an optimization for removing these assign statements in rustc
//! itself. When this optimization runs fast enough, it can also speed up the constant evaluation
//! and code generation phases of rustc due to the reduced number of statements and locals.
//!
//! # The Optimization
//!
//! Conceptually, this optimization is "destination propagation". It is similar to the Named Return
//! Value Optimization, or NRVO, known from the C++ world, except that it isn't limited to return
//! values or the return place `_0`. On a very high level, independent of the actual implementation
//! details, it does the following:
//!
//! 1) Identify `dest = src;` statements that can be soundly eliminated.
//! 2) Replace all mentions of `src` with `dest` ("unifying" them and propagating the destination
//!    backwards).
//! 3) Delete the `dest = src;` statement (by making it a `nop`).
//!
//! Step 1) is by far the hardest, so it is explained in more detail below.
//!
//! ## Soundness
//!
//! Given an `Assign` statement `dest = src;`, where `dest` is a `Place` and `src` is an `Rvalue`,
//! there are a few requirements that must hold for the optimization to be sound:
//!
//! * `dest` must not contain any *indirection* through a pointer. It must access part of the base
//!   local. Otherwise it might point to arbitrary memory that is hard to track.
//!
//!   It must also not contain any indexing projections, since those take an arbitrary `Local` as
//!   the index, and that local might only be initialized shortly before `dest` is used.
//!
//!   Subtle case: If `dest` is a, or projects through a union, then we have to make sure that there
//!   remains an assignment to it, since that sets the "active field" of the union. But if `src` is
//!   a ZST, it might not be initialized, so there might not be any use of it before the assignment,
//!   and performing the optimization would simply delete the assignment, leaving `dest`
//!   uninitialized.
//!
//! * `src` must be a bare `Local` without any indirections or field projections (FIXME: Is this a
//!   fundamental restriction or just current impl state?). It can be copied or moved by the
//!   assignment.
//!
//! * The `dest` and `src` locals must never be [*live*][liveness] at the same time. If they are, it
//!   means that they both hold a (potentially different) value that is needed by a future use of
//!   the locals. Unifying them would overwrite one of the values.
//!
//!   Note that computing liveness of locals that have had their address taken is more difficult:
//!   Short of doing full escape analysis on the address/pointer/reference, the pass would need to
//!   assume that any operation that can potentially involve opaque user code (such as function
//!   calls, destructors, and inline assembly) may access any local that had its address taken
//!   before that point.
//!
//! Here, the first two conditions are simple structural requirements on the `Assign` statements
//! that can be trivially checked. The liveness requirement however is more difficult and costly to
//! check.
//!
//! ## Previous Work
//!
//! A [previous attempt] at implementing an optimization like this turned out to be a significant
//! regression in compiler performance. Fixing the regressions introduced a lot of undesirable
//! complexity to the implementation.
//!
//! A [subsequent approach] tried to avoid the costly computation by limiting itself to acyclic
//! CFGs, but still turned out to be far too costly to run due to suboptimal performance within
//! individual basic blocks, requiring a walk across the entire block for every assignment found
//! within the block. For the `tuple-stress` benchmark, which has 458745 statements in a single
//! block, this proved to be far too costly.
//!
//! Since the first attempt at this, the compiler has improved dramatically, and new analysis
//! frameworks have been added that should make this approach viable without requiring a limited
//! approach that only works for some classes of CFGs:
//! - rustc now has a powerful dataflow analysis framework that can handle forwards and backwards
//!   analyses efficiently.
//! - Layout optimizations for generators have been added to improve code generation for
//!   async/await, which are very similar in spirit to what this optimization does. Both walk the
//!   MIR and record conflicting uses of locals in a `BitMatrix`.
//!
//! Also, rustc now has a simple NRVO pass (see `nrvo.rs`), which handles a subset of the cases that
//! this destination propagation pass handles, proving that similar optimizations can be performed
//! on MIR.
//!
//! ## Pre/Post Optimization
//!
//! It is recommended to run `SimplifyCfg` and then `SimplifyLocals` some time after this pass, as
//! it replaces the eliminated assign statements with `nop`s and leaves unused locals behind.
//!
//! [liveness]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_variable_analysis
//! [previous attempt]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/47954
