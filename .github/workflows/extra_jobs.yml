# Workflow that execute jobs based on the files that were changed or some label configuration.
#
# The first job in this workflow will auto label the PR, while the following jobs will conditionally
# run according to the auto-label result.
#
# This workflow runs on `pull_request_target` because the labeler needs extra write permission.
# Thus, we keep this job minimal, and the only actions used are from the same verified publisher.
#
# Other jobs should not require extra permissions, so be careful when adding new jobs to not propagate write
# permissions.
#
# Note that this also means that the workflow version run is the one currently in `main`,
# not the one from the PR. This is only relevant if a PR is changing this workflow.
#
# See <https://github.com/actions/labeler/issues/121> for more details.
