# Installation

There are two ways to install Kani:

1. By downloading
[pre-compiled release binaries](./install-pre-compiled.md).
This is suitable for Kani users who don't
expect to change the source code.
2. By [compiling the source code](./install-from-source.md).
This is good for Kani developers.

After installing, you can check your install
by [running a basic Kani test](./install-check.md).

Currently, only two platforms are supported:

* `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `x86_64-apple-darwin`
