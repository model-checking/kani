# Installation

There are two ways to install Kani:

1. **Default**:
[install pre-compiled release binaries](./install-pre-compiled.md).
Use this option unless you need the features listed below.
2. [Build from source code](./install-from-source.md).
This is more suitable for Kani developers
or users who want to try the latest changes.

Currently, only two platforms are supported:

* `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `x86_64-apple-darwin`
