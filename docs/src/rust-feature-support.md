# Rust feature support

The table below tries to summarize the current support in Kani for
the Rust language features according to the [Rust Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/).
We use the following values to indicate the level of support:
 * **Yes**: The feature is fully supported. We are not aware of any issue with it.
 * **Partial**: The feature is at least partially supported. We are aware of some issue with
 with it.
 * **No**: The feature is not supported. Some support may be available but analyses should not be trusted.

As with all software, bugs may be found anywhere regardless of the level of support. In such cases, we
would greatly appreciate that you [filed a bug report](https://github.com/model-checking/kani/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md).

## Notes on partially or unsupported features

### Code generation for unsupported features

Kani aims to be an industrial verification tool. Most industrial crates may
include unsupported features in parts of their code that do not need to be
verified. In general, this should not prevent users using Kani to verify their code.

Because of that, the general rule is that Kani generates an `assert(false)`
statement followed by an `assume(false)` statement when compiling any
unsupported feature. `assert(false)` will cause verification to fail if the
statement is reachable during the verification stage, while `assume(false)` will
block any further exploration of the path. However, the analysis will not be
affected if the statement is not reachable from the code under verification, so
users can still verify components of their code that do not use unsupported
features.

In a few cases, Kani aborts execution if the analysis could be affected in
some way because of an unsupported feature (e.g., global ASM).

### Assembly

Kani does not support assembly code for now. We may add it in the future but at
present there are no plans to do so.

Check out the tracking issues for [inline assembly (`asm!`
macro)](https://github.com/model-checking/kani/issues/2) and [global assembly
(`asm_global!` macro)](https://github.com/model-checking/kani/issues/316) to know
more about the current status.

### Concurrency

Concurrent features are currently out of scope for Kani. In general, the
verification of concurrent programs continues to be an open research problem
where most tools that analyze concurrent code lack support for other features.
Because of this, Kani emits a warning whenever it encounters concurrent code and
compiles as if it was sequential code.

### Standard library functions

Kani [overrides](./overrides.md) a few common functions
(e.g., print macros) to provide a more verification friendly implementation.

### Advanced features

The semantics around some advanced features (traits, types, etc.) from Rust are
not formally defined which makes it harder to ensure that we can properly model
all their use cases.

In particular, there are some outstanding issues to note here:
 * Unimplemented `PointerCast::ClosureFnPointer` in
   [#274](https://github.com/model-checking/kani/issues/274) and `Variant` case
   in projections type in
   [#448](https://github.com/model-checking/kani/issues/448).
 * Unexpected fat pointer results in
   [#277](https://github.com/model-checking/kani/issues/277),
   [#327](https://github.com/model-checking/kani/issues/327) and
   [#676](https://github.com/model-checking/kani/issues/676).

We are particularly interested in bug reports concerning
these features, so please [file a bug
report](https://github.com/model-checking/kani/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md)
if you're aware of one.

### Panic strategies

Rust has two different strategies when a panic occurs:
 1. Stack unwinding (default): Walks back the stack cleaning up the data from
    each function it encounters.
 2. Abortion: Immediately ends the program without cleaning up.

Currently, Kani does not support stack unwinding. This has some implications
regarding memory safety since programs sometimes rely on the unwinding logic to
ensure there is no resource leak or persistent data inconsistency. Check out
[this issue](https://github.com/model-checking/kani/issues/692) for updates on
stack unwinding support.

### Uninitialized memory

Reading uninitialized memory is
[considered undefined behavior](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html#behavior-considered-undefined) in Rust.
At the moment, Kani cannot detect if memory is uninitialized, but in practice
this is mitigated by the fact that all memory is initialized with
nondeterministic values.
Therefore, any code that depends on uninitialized data will exhibit nondeterministic behavior.
See [this issue](https://github.com/model-checking/kani/issues/920) for more details.

### Destructors

At present, we are aware of some issues with destructors, in particular those
related to [advanced features](#advanced-features).

### Intrinsics

Please refer to [Intrinsics](rust-feature-support/intrinsics.md) for information
on the current support in Kani for Rust compiler intrinsics.
