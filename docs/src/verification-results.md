# Verification results

The result of a check in Kani can be one of the following:

1. `SUCCESS`: This indicates that the check passed, i.e., the property holds.
Note that in some cases, the property may hold _vacuously_. This can occur
because the property is unreachable, or because the harness is
_over-constrained_.

Example:
```rust
{{#include getting-started/verification-results/src/main.rs:success_example}}
```
The output from Kani indicates that the assertion holds:
```
Check 4: success_example.assertion.4
         - Status: SUCCESS
         - Description: "assertion failed: sum == 6"
```

2. `FAILURE`: This indicates that the check failed, i.e., the property doesn't
hold. In this case, you can view the failure trace by re-running with the
`--visualize` option.  This generates a directory that contains the trace
information. Load the `html/index.html` file from that directory in a browser to
examine the trace.

Example:
```rust
{{#include getting-started/verification-results/src/main.rs:failure_example}}
```
The assertion doesn't hold as Kani's output indicates:
```
Check 2: failure_example.assertion.2
         - Status: FAILURE
         - Description: "assertion failed: arr.len() != 3"
```

3. `UNREACHABLE`: This indicates that the check is unreachable. This occurs when
there is no possible execution trace that can reach the check's line of code.
This may be because the function that contains the check is unused, or that the
harness does not trigger the condition under which the check is invoked. Kani
currently checks the reachability of the following assertion types:
    1. Assert macros (e.g. `assert`, `assert_eq`, etc.)
    2. Arithmetic overflow checks
    3. Negation overflow checks
    4. Index out-of-bound checks
    5. Divide/remainder-by-zero checks


Example:

```rust
{{#include getting-started/verification-results/src/main.rs:unreachable_example}}
```

The output from Kani indicates that the assertion is unreachable:
```
Check 2: unreachable_example.assertion.2
         - Status: UNREACHABLE
         - Description: "assertion failed: x < 8"
```

4. `UNDETERMINED`: This indicates that Kani was not able to conclude whether the
property holds or not. This can occur when the Rust program contains a construct
that is not currently supported by Kani. See
[Rust feature support](./rust-feature-support.md) for Kani's current support of the
Rust language features.

Example:
```rust
{{#include getting-started/verification-results/src/main.rs:undetermined_example}}
```
The output from Kani indicates that the assertion is undetermined due to the
missing support for inline assembly in Kani:
```
Check 2: undetermined_example.assertion.2
         - Status: UNDETERMINED
         - Description: "assertion failed: x == 0"
```
