# Crates documentation

Kani currently ships with a couple crates that provide APIs to allow users to
write and configure their harnesses.
These APIs are tightly coupled with each Kani version, so they are not
published yet at <crates.io>.

You can find their latest documentation here:
  - [kani](https://model-checking.github.io/kani/crates/kani): This crate
  provide APIs to write Kani harnesses.
  - [kani_macros](https://model-checking.github.io/kani/crates/kani_macros):
  This crate provides `proc_macro` definitions that allow users to configure their
  harnesses using function attributes.
