# Automatic Harness Generation

Recall the harness for `estimate_size` that we wrote in [First Steps](../../tutorial-first-steps.md):
```rust
{{#include ../../tutorial/first-steps-v1/src/lib.rs:kani}}
```

This harness first declares a local variable `x` using `kani::any()`, then calls `estimate_size` with argument `x`.
Many proof harnesses follow this predictable format—to verify a function `foo`, we create arbitrary values for each of `foo`'s arguments, then call `foo` on those arguments.

The `autoharness` subcommand leverages this observation to automatically generate harnesses and run Kani against them.
Kani scans the crate for functions whose arguments all implement the `kani::Arbitrary` trait, generates harnesses for them, then runs them.
These harnesses are internal to Kani—i.e., Kani does not make any changes to your source code.

## Usage
Run either:
```
# cargo kani autoharness -Z autoharness
```
or
```
# kani autoharness -Z autoharness <FILE>
```

If Kani detects that all of a function `foo`'s arguments implement `kani::Arbitrary`, it will generate and run a `#[kani::proof]` harness, which prints:

```
Autoharness: Checking function foo against all possible inputs...
<VERIFICATION RESULTS>
```

However, if Kani detects that `foo` has a [function contract](./contracts.md), it will instead generate a `#[kani::proof_for_contract]` harness and verify the contract:
```
Autoharness: Checking function foo's contract against all possible inputs...
<VERIFICATION RESULTS>
```

Similarly, Kani will detect the presence of [loop contracts](./loop-contracts.md) and verify them.

Thus, `-Z autoharness` implies `-Z function-contracts` and `-Z loop-contracts`, i.e., opting into the experimental
autoharness feature means that you are also opting into the function contracts and loop contracts features.

Kani generates and runs these harnesses internally—the user only sees the verification results.

### Options
The `autoharness` subcommand has options `--include-function` and `--exclude-function` to include and exclude particular functions.
These flags look for partial matches against the fully qualified name of a function.

For example, if a module `my_module` has many functions, but we are only interested in `my_module::foo` and `my_module::bar`, we can run:
```
cargo run autoharness -Z autoharness --include-function foo --include-function bar
```
To exclude `my_module` entirely, run:
```
cargo run autoharness -Z autoharness --exclude-function my_module
```

## Example
Using the `estimate_size` example from [First Steps](../../tutorial-first-steps.md) again:
```rust
{{#include ../../tutorial/first-steps-v1/src/lib.rs:code}}
```

We get:

```
# cargo kani autoharness -Z autoharness
Autoharness: Checking function estimate_size against all possible inputs...
RESULTS:
Check 3: estimate_size.assertion.1

         - Description: "Oh no, a failing corner case!"

## Request for comments
This feature is experimental and is therefore subject to change.
If you have ideas for improving the user experience of this feature,
please add them to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/model-checking/kani/issues/3832).

## Limitations
### Arguments Implementing Arbitrary
Kani will only generate an automatic harness for a function if it can determine that all of the function's arguments implement Arbitrary.
It does not attempt to derive/implement Arbitrary for any types, even if those types could implement Arbitrary.
For example, imagine a user defines `struct MyStruct { x: u8, y: u8}`, but does not derive or implement Arbitrary for `MyStruct`.
Kani does not attempt to add such derivations itself, so it will not generate a harness for a function that takes `MyStruct` as input.

### Generic Functions
The current implementation does not generate harnesses for generic functions.
For example, given:
```rust
fn foo<T: Eq>(x: T, y: T) {
    if x == y {
        panic!("x and y are equal");
    }
}
```
Kani would report that no functions were eligible for automatic harness generation.

If, however, some caller of `foo` is eligible for an automatic harness, then a monomorphized version of `foo` may still be reachable during verification.
For instance, if we add `main`:
```rust
fn main() {
    let x: u8 = 2;
    let y: u8 = 2;
    foo(x, y);
}
```
and run the autoharness subcommand, we get:
```
Autoharness: Checking function main against all possible inputs...

Failed Checks: x and y are equal
 File: "src/lib.rs", line 3, in foo::<u8>

VERIFICATION:- FAILED
```
