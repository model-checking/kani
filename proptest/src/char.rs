//! biased to particular values known to be difficult to handle in various

//!
//! The main things of interest are `any()` to generate truly arbitrary

/// locating edge cases, since the vast majority of code points (such as the
/// enormous CJK regions) don't cause problems for anything with even basic
/// Unicode support.

/// Instead, character selection is always based on explicit ranges, and is
/// designed to bias to specifically chosen characters and character ranges to
/// produce inputs that are both more useful and easier for humans to
/// understand. There are also hard-wired simplification targets based on ASCII
/// instead of simply simplifying towards NUL to avoid problematic inputs being
/// reduced to a bunch of NUL characters.

/// Shrinking never crosses ranges. If you have a complex range like `[A-Za-z]`

/// group, but rather simply to `a`.

/// constant or `range` function. Directly constructing a `CharStrategy` is
