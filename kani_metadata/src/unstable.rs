//! Unified handling of unstable feature flags across Kani.
//!
//! The central types are [`UnstableFeature`], which describes a single feature
//! and is intended as a small, cheap enum that is [`Copy`].
//! [`EnabledUnstableFeatures`] then describes which [`UnstableFeature`]s are
//! enabled.
//!
//! To check if a feature is enabled use [`EnabledUnstableFeatures::contains`].
//!
//! ### Parsing
//!
//! [`EnabledUnstableFeatures`] is intended to be used with the [`clap`]
//! "derive" API. You can directly drop it into a command line arguments struct
//! like so:
//!
//! ```
//! # use kani_metadata::unstable::*;
//! use clap::Parser;
//!
//! #[derive(Parser)]
//! struct MyCmdArgs {
//!     // ...
//!     #[clap(flatten)]
//!     unstable: EnabledUnstableFeatures,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Which will add the long form `--unstable feature-name` and short form `-Z
//! feature-name` options to your argument parser.
//!
//! **Note:** [`clap`] internally uses a unique name (string) to refer to each
//! argument or group, which is usually derived from the field name.
//! [`EnabledUnstableFeatures`] uses the internal name
//! `"enabled_unstable_features"` which may therefore not be used (as a field
//! name) in the embedding argument struct, e.g. `MyCmdArgs`.
//!
//! ### Reusing
//!
//! You can turn an [`UnstableFeature`] back into it's command line
//! representation. This should be done with
//! [`EnabledUnstableFeatures::as_arguments`], which returns an iterator that,
//! when passed to e.g. [`std::process::Command::args`] will enable those
//! features in the subsequent call.
//!
//! You can also serialize a single feature with
//! [`UnstableFeature::as_argument`].
//!
//! Both of these methods return values that are ready for direct usage on the
//! command line, e.g one or more `-Z feature-name`. If you need only the
//! serialized name of the feature use [`UnstableFeature::as_ref`].

/// A single unstable feature. This is where you should register your own if you
/// are adding new ones, e.g. as part of the RFC process.
