### Breaking Changes
* Change default solver to CaDiCaL by @celinval in https://github.com/model-checking/kani/pull/2557

or by passing `--solver=<SOLVER>` command line option.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/model-checking/kani/compare/kani-0.24.0...kani-0.25.0

## [0.23.0]

### Breaking Changes

- Remove the second parameter in the `kani::any_where` function by @zhassan-aws in #2257
We removed the second parameter in the `kani::any_where` function (`_msg: &'static str`) to make the function more ergonomic to use.
We suggest moving the explanation for why the assumption is introduced into a comment.
For example, the following code:
```rust
    let len: usize = kani::any_where(|x| *x < 5, "Restrict the length to a value less than 5");
```
should be replaced by:
```rust
    // Restrict the length to a value less than 5
    let len: usize = kani::any_where(|x| *x < 5);
```

### Major Changes

- Enable the build cache to avoid recompiling crates that haven't changed, and introduce `--force-build` option to compile all crates from scratch by @celinval in #2232.
