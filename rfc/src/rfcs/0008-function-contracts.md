## Summary

Contracts are a powerful tool for verification. They are both a convenient way
to write specifications as well as allowing users to soundly approximate the
behavior of units of code. The verification tool then leverages these
approximations for modular verification which affords both scalability, but also
allows for verifying unbounded loops and recursion.

<!-- Shorter? -->

## User Impact

<!-- Is basically the pitch and addressing the user. -->

Function contracts are a mechanism for a stubbing-like abstraction of concrete
implementations but with a significantly reduced threat to soundness. It also
lays the ground work for the following two ambitious goals.

- **Scalability:** Function contracts are sound (over)abstractions of function
  behavior. By verifiying the contract against its implemetation and
  subsequently performing caller verification against the (cheaper) abstraction
  verification can be modularized, cached and thus scaled.
- **Unbounded Verification:** Contracts can be reasoned over inductively and
  thus verify recursive functions.

Enabling function contracts is a non-invasive change. While it contains a new
API, that API is strictly additive for users. All prior operations are unchanged.

A `-Zcontracts` guard will be added wich is necessary to access any of the
contract functionality (attributes) described below. Any use of such attributes
without `-Zcontracts` is a compile time error.

### Caveats

This proposal focuses on scalability benefits within a single verification session,
caching strategies for cross-session speedup are left to future work.

We add function contract functionality, but do not add the indictive reasoning
support needed for many unbounded problems, such as "deacreases" measures and
inductive lemmas.

## User Experience

Function contracts provide a way to approximate function behavior, verify the
approximation and subsequently use the approximation instead if the (possibly
costly) implementation. The lifecycle of a contract is split roughly into three
phases. Which we will explore on this simple example:

```rs
fn my_div(dividend: u32, divisor: u32) -> u32 {
  dividend / divisor
}
```

1. In the first phase we **specify** the approximation. Kani provides two new
   annotations: `requires` (preconditions) to describe the expectations this
   function has as to the calling context and `ensures` (postconditions) which
   approximates function outputs in terms of function inputs.

   ```rs
   #[kani::requires(divisor != 0)]
   #[kani::ensures(result <= dividend)]
   fn my_div(dividend: u32, divisor: u32) -> u32 {
     dividend / divisor
   }
   ```
  
   `requires` here indicates this function expects its `divisor` input to never
   be 0, or it will not execute correctly (i.e. panic).

   `ensures` puts a bound on the output, relative to the `dividend` input.

   Conditions in contracts are plain Rust expressions which can reference the
   function arguments and, in case of `ensures`, the `result`[^result-naming]
   result of the function. Syntactically Kani supports any Rust expression,
   including function calls, defining types etc, however they must be
   side-effect free[^side-effects]. Multiple `requires` and `ensrues` clauses
   are allowed on the same function, they are implicitly logically conjoined.

   [^result-naming]: See [open questions](#open-questions) for a discussion
       about naming of the result variable.

2. Checking the Contract

   Next Kani must make sure that the approximation we specified actually holds.
   This is in opposition to the related "stubbing" mechanism, where the
   approximation is not checked but always trusted.

   Kani must check that contract overapproximates the function to guarantee
   soundness. Specifically the domain (inputs) of the function described (by the
   `requires` clause) must be *at most* as large as the input space for which
   the function's behavior is well defined, and the codomain (outputs, described
   by `ensures`) must be *at least* as large as the actual space of outputs the
   function may produce.

   For example in our case it would be permissible to use
   `#[kani::requires(divisor > 100)]` (smaller permissible input domain) or
   `#[kani::ensures(result < dividend + divisor)]` (larger possible output
   domain), but e.g. `#[kani::ensures(result < dividend)]` (small output) is not
   allowed.

   To facilitate the check Kani needs a suitable environment to verify our
   function in. For this proposal the environment must be provided by us (the
   users). See [future possibilities](#future-possibilities) for a discussion
   about the arising soundness issues and their remedies.

   We provide the checking environment for our contract with a special new
   `proof_for_contract` harness.

   ```rs
   #[kani::proof_for_contract(my_div)]
   fn my_div_harness() {
     my_div(kani::any(), kani::any())
   }
   ```

   Similar to a unit-test harness for any other function we are supposed to
   create inputs for the function that are as generic/abstract as possible to
   make sure we catch all edge cases, then call the function at least once with
   those abstract inputs. If we forget to call `my_div` Kani would report an
   error.
   
   Unlike a unit-test we can however elide any checks of the output and
   post-call state. Instead Kani uses the conditions we specified in the
   contract as checks. It inserts the preconditions (`requires`) of `my_div` as
   `kani::assume` *before* the call to `my_div`, to ensure it only tests the
   function on inputs it is actually defined for. Postconditions (`ensures`) are
   inserted as `kani::assert` checks *after* the call to `my_div`. 

   The expanded version of our harness and function is equivalent to the following:

   ```rs
   #[kani::proof]
   fn my_div_harness() {
     let dividend = kani::any();
     let divisor = kani::any();
     kani::assume(divisor != 0);
     let result = my_div(dividend, divisor);
     kani::assert(result <= dividend);
   }
   ```

   This expanded harness is then verified like any other harness but also gives
   the green light for the next step: verified stubbing.

3. In the last phase the **verified** contract is ready for us to use to
   **stub** in other harnesses.

   Unlike in regular stubbing Kani there to be at least one associated
   `proof_for_contract` harness for each function to stub *and* it requires all
   such harnesses to pass verification before attempting verification of any
   harnesses that use it as a stub.

   A possible harness that uses our `my_div` contract could be the following:

   ```rs
   #[kani::proof]
   #[kani::stub_verified(my_div)]
   fn use_div() {
     let v = vec![...];
     let some_idx = my_div(v.len() - 1, 3);
     v[some_idx];
   }
   ```

   To use the contract as a stub Kani must first ensure the calling context is
   safe. It a `kani::assert` for the preconditions (`requires`) of `my_div`
   before the call. Then it replaces the result of `my_div` with a
   non-deterministic value (see [havocing](#memory-predicates-and-havocing) for
   the equivalent for mutable memory), constrained by a `kani::assume` of
   `'my_div`'s postconditions (`ensures`).

   And the expanded version is equivalent to this:
  
   ```rs
   #[kani::proof]
   #[kani::stub_verified(my_div)]
   fn use_div() {
     let v = vec![...];
     let dividend = v.len() - 1;
     let divisor = 3;
     kani::assert(divisor != 0);
     let result = kani::any();
     kani::assume(result <= dividend);
     let some_idx = result;
     v[some_idx];
   }
   ```

   Notice that this performs no actual computation for `my_div` (other than the
   conditions) which allows us to avoid something potentially costly.

Also notice that Kani was able to express both contract checking and stubbing
with existing capabilities, the important feature is the enforcement. The
checking is, by construction, performed **against the same condition** that is
later used as stub, which ensures soundness (see discussion on lingering threats
to soundness in the [future](#future-possibilities) section) and guards against
stubs diverging from their checks.

### History Variables

Kani's contract language contains additional support for reasoning about changes
to memory. One case where this is necessary is whenever `ensures` needs to
reason about state before the function call. By default it only has access to
state after the call completes, which will be different if the call mutates
memory.

Consider the `Vec::pop` function

```rs
impl<T> Vec<T> {
  fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<T> {
    ...
  }
}
```

If we want to describe in which case the result is `Some`, we need to know
whether `self` is empty *before* `pop` is called. To do this Kani provides the
`old(EXPR)` pseudo function, which evaluates `EXPR` before the call (e.g. to
`pop`) and makes the result available to `ensures`. it would be used like so

```rs
impl<T> Vec<T> {
  #[kani::ensures(old(self.is_empty()) || result.is_some())]
  fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<T> {
    ...
  }
}
```

`old` allows evaluating any (side-effect free[^side-effects]) Rust expression
but Rust enforces that it does not borrow so as to observe the mutations from
e.g. `pop`, as that would defeat the purpose. Instead Kani encourages us to make
copies (using e.g. `clone()`) if necessary.

Note also that `old` is syntax, not a function and implemented as an extraction
and lifting during code generation. It can reference e.g. `pop`'s arguments but
not local variables. Compare the following

**Invalid ‚ùå:** `#[kani::ensures({ let x = self.is_empty(); old(x) } || result.is_some())]`
**Valid ‚úÖ:** `#[kani::ensures(old({ let x = self.is_empty(); x }) || result.is_some())]`

And it will only be recognized as `old(...)`, not as `let old1 = old; old1(...)` etc.

### Memory Predicates and Havocing

The last new feature added are predicates to refine a function's access to heap
memory. A memory footprint is used by the verifier to perform "havocing" during
contract stubbing. Recall that stubbing replaces the result value with a
non-deterministic `kani::any()`, havocing is the equivalent memory regions
touched by the function. Any memory regions in the footprint are "havoced" by
the verifier, that is replaced by a non-deterministic value (subject to type
constraints).

By default Kani infers a memory footprint as all memory reachable from a `&mut`
input or any `static` global referenced, directly or transitively, by the
function. While the inferred footprint is sound and enough for successful
contract checking[^inferred-footprint] it can easily turn large section of
memory to non-deterministic values, invalidate invariants of your program and
cause the verification to fail when the contract is used as a stub.

[^inferred-footprint]: While inferred memory footprints are sound for both safe
    and unsafe rust certain features in unsafe rust (e.g. `RefCell`) get
    inferred incorrectly and will lead to a failing contract check.

To reduce the scope of havocing Kani provides the `#[kani::assigns(CONDITION,
ASSIGN_RANGE...)]` and `#[kani::frees(CONDITION, LVALUE...)]` attributes. When
these attributes are provided Kani will only havoc the location mentioned in
`ASSIGN_RANGE` and `LVALUE` instead of the inferred footprint. Additionally Kani
verifies during checking that only the mentioned memory regions are touched and
only under the mentioned conditions.

`CONDITION`s limit when the clause applies, may reference the arguments of the
function and can be omitted.

`LVALUE` are simple expressions permissible on the left hand side of an
assignment. They compose of the name of one function argument and zero or more
projections (dereference `*`, field access `.x`, slice indexing `[1]`).

The `ASSIGN_RANGE` permits any `LVALUE` but additionally permits more complex
slice expressions as the last projection and applies to pointer values. `[..]`
denotes the entirety of an allocation, `[i..]`, `[..j]` and `[i..j]` are
ranges of pointer offsets. A slicing syntax `p[i..j]` only applies if `p` is a
`*mut T` and points to an array allocation. The slice indices are offsets with
sizing `T`, e.g. in Rust `p[i..j]` would be equivalent to
`std::slice::from_raw_parts(p.offset(i), i - j)`. `i` must be smaller or equal
than `j`.

Because lvalues are restricted to using projections only Kani must break
encapsulation here. If need be we may reference fields that are usually hidden,
without an error from the compiler.

[^side-effects]: Code used in contracts is required to be side effect free which
    means it must not perform I/O, mutate memory (`&mut` vars and such) and
    (de)allocate heap memory. This is enforced by the verifier, see the
    discussion in the [future](#future-possibilities) section.

## Detailed Design

<!-- For the implementors or the hackers -->

Kani implements the functionality of function contracts in two places.

1. Code generation in the `requires` and `ensures` macros.
2. GOTO level contracts using CBMC's contract language generated in
   `kani-compiler` for handling memory predicates.

With some additional plumbing in the compiler and the driver.

### Code generation in `kani_macros`

The `requires` and `ensures` macros perform code generation in the macro,
creating a `check` and a `replace` function which use `assert` and `assume` as
described in the [user expersection](#user-experience) section. Both are
attached via a `kanitool` attribute to the function which they are checking and
replacing respectively. See also the [discussion](#rationale-and-alternatives)
about why we decided to generate check and replace functions like this.

The code generation in the macros is straightforward, save two aspects: `old`
and the borrow checker.

The special `old` builtin function is implemented as an AST rewrite. Consider
the below example:

```rs
impl<T> Vec<T> {
  #[kani::ensures(self.is_empty() || self.len() == old(self.len()) - 1)]
  fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<T> {
    ...
  }
}
```

The `ensures` macro performs an AST rewrite constiting of an extraction of the
expressions in `old` and a replacement with a fresh local variable, creating the
following:

```rs
impl<T> Vec<T> {
  fn check_pop(&mut self) -> Option<T> {
    let old_1 = self.len();
    let result = Self::pop(self);
    kani::assert(self.is_empty() || self.len() == old_1 - 1)
  }
}
```

Nested invocations of `old` are prohibited (Kani throws an error) and the
expression inside may only refer to the function arguments and not other local
variables in the contract (Rust will report those variables as not being in
scope). 

The borrow checker also ensures for us that none of the temporary variables
borrow in a way that would be able to observe the moditication in `pop` which
would occur for instance if the user wrote `old(self)`. Instead of borrowing
copies should be created (e.g. `old(self.clone())`). This is only enforced for
safe rust though.

The second part relevant for the implementation is how we deal with the borrow
checker. Postconditions (`ensures`) reference the arguments of the function,
though don't modify them. However this is problematic even without modification
if part of an input is borrowed mutably in the return value. For instance the
`Vec::split_at_mut` function does this and a sensible contract for it might look
as follows:

```rs
impl<T> Vec<T> {
  #[ensures(self.len() == result.0.len() + result.1.len())]
  fn split_at_mut(&mut self, i: usize) -> (&mut [T], &mut [T]) {
    ...
  }
}
```

This contract refers simultaneously to `self` and the result. Since the method
however borrows `self` mutably, the borrow checker would complain about a simple
`assert` of the postcondition. To work around this we strategically break the
borrowing rules using a new hidden builtin `kani::unckecked_deref` with the type
signature `for <T> fn (&T) -> T` which is essentially a C-style dereference
operation. Breaking the borrow checker like this is safe for 2 reasons:

1. Postconditions are not allowed perform mutation[^side-effects] and
2. Post conditions are of type `bool`, meaning they cannot leak references to
   the arguments and cause race conditions.

The "copies" of arguments created by by `unsafe_deref` are stored as fresh local
variables and their occurrence in the postcondition is renamed.

### Changes to Other Components

Contract enforcement and replacement (`kani::proof_for_contract(f)`,
`kani::verified_stub(f)`) both dispats to the stubbing logic, replacing `f` with
the generated check and replace function respectively. If `f` has no contract,
an error is thrown.

For memory predicates Kani relies on CBMC. Generated memory predicates (whether
derived from types of from explicit clauses) are emitted from the compiler as
GOTO contracts in the artifact. Then the driver invokes `goto-instrument` with
the name of the GOTO-level function names to enforce or replace the memory
contracts. The compiler communicates the names of the function via harness
metadata.

- **Kani-side implementation vs CBMC** Instead of generating check and replace
  functions in Kani, we could use the contract instrumentation provided by CBMC.
  We tried this earlier but came up short, because it is difficult to implement,
  while supporting arbitrary Rust syntax. We exported the conditions into
  functions so that Rust would do the parsing/type checking/lowering for us and
  then call the lowered function in the CBMC contract. The trouble is that
  CBMC's `old` is only supported directly in the contract, not in functions
  called from the contract. This means we either need to inline the contract
  function body, which is brittle in the presence if control flow, or we must
  extract the `old` expressions, evaluate them in the contract directly and pass
  the results to the check function. However this means we must restrict the
  expressions in `old`, because we now need to lower those by hand and even if
  we could let rustc do it, CBMC's old has no support for function calls in its
  argument expression.
- **Expanding all contract macros at the same time** Instead of expanding
  contract macros one-at-a-atime and creating the onion layer structure we could
  expand all subsequent one's with the outermost one, creating only one check
  and replace function each. This is however brittle with respect to renaming.
  If a user does `use kani::requires as my_requires` and then does multiple
  `#[my_requires(condition)]` macro would not collect them properly since it can
  only mathc syntactically and it does not know about the `use` and neither can
  we restrict this kind if use or warn the user. By contrast the collection with
  `kanitool::checked_with` is safe, because that attribute is generated by our
  macro itself, so we can rely on the fact that it uses then canonical
  representation.
- **Generating nested functions instead of siblings** Instead of generating the
  `check` and `replace` functions as siblings to the contracted function we
  could nest them like so

  ```rs
  fn my_div(dividend: u32, divisor: u32) -> u32 {
    fn my_div_check_5e3713(dividend: u32, divisor: u32) -> u32 {
      ...
    }
    ...
  }
  ```

  This could be beneficial if we want to be able to allow contracts on trait
  impl items, in which case generating sibling functions is not allowed. The
  only thing required to make this work is an additional pass over the condition
  that replaces every `self` with a fresh identifier that now becomes the first
  argument of the function.
- **Explicit command line checking/substitution vs attributes**

## Open questions

<!-- For Developers -->

- We assume here entirely derived assigns clauses, instead of explicit one's.
- Semantics of arguments in postconditions: Shold they reflect changes to `mut`
  arguments, e.g. a `mut i: u32`? I think that even in other tools (e.g. CBMC)
  the actual value of arguments is copied into the function and therefore
  changes to it are not reflected.
- Trait contracts
- Is it really correct to return `kani::any()` from the replacement copy, even
  if it can be a pointer?
- Our handling of `impl` in `reuqires` and `ensures` macros is brittle, though
  probably can't be improved. If the contracted function is an `impl` item, then
  the call to the next onion layer has to be `Self::<next fn>()` instead of
  `<next fn>()`. However we have no reliable way of knowing when we are in an
  `impl` fn. The macro uses a heuristic (is `self` or `Self` present) but in
  theory a user can declare an `impl` fn that never uses either `Self` or `self`
  in which case we generate broken code that throws cryptic error messages.
- Making result special. Should we use special syntax here like `@result` or
  `kani::result()`, though with the latter I worry that people may get confused
  because it is syntactic and not subject to usual `use` renaming and import
  semantics. Alternatively we can let the user pick the name with an additional
  argument to `ensures`, e.g. `ensures(my_result_var, CONDITION)`

## Future possibilities

<!-- For Developers -->

- Enforcing contract checking before substitution
- Quantifiers
- Side effect freedom is currently enforced by CBMC. This means that the error
  originates there and is likely not legible. Intead Kani should perform a
  reachability analysis from the contract expressions and determine whether side
  effects are possible, throwing a graceful error.
- Soundness issues with harnesses and remedies that are in the works
- What about mutable trait inputs (wrt memory access patters), e.g. a `mut impl AccessMe`

scope of this RFC? Feel free to brainstorm here.
