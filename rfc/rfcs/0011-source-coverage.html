<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>A source-based code coverage feature for Kani built on top of Rust's coverage instrumentation.</p>
<h2 id="user-impact"><a class="header" href="#user-impact">User Impact</a></h2>
<p>In our first attempt to add a coverage feature fully managed by Kani, we introduced and made available a line coverage option
(see <a href="0008-line-coverage.html">RFC: Line coverage</a> for more details).
This option has since then allowed us to gather more data around the expectations for a coverage feature in Kani.</p>
<p>For example, the line coverage output we produced was not easy to interpret
without knowing some implementation details.
Aside from that, the feature requested in
<a href="https://github.com/model-checking/kani/issues/2795">#2795</a> alludes to the need
of providing coverage-specific tooling in Kani.
Nevertheless, as captured in
<a href="https://github.com/model-checking/kani/issues/2640">#2640</a>, source-based
coverage results provide the clearest and most precise coverage information.</p>
<p>In this RFC, we propose an integration with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/instrument-coverage.html">Rust's source-based code coverage
instrumentation</a>.
This integration would allow us to report source-based code coverage results from Kani.
Also, we propose adding a new user-facing, coverage-focused tool called <code>kani-cov</code>.
The tool would allow users to process coverage results generated by Kani and produce
coverage artifacts such as summaries and reports according to their preferences.
In the <a href="#user-experience">next section</a>, we will explain in more detail how we
expect <code>kani-cov</code> to assist with coverage-related tasks.</p>
<p>With these changes, we expect our coverage options to become more flexible,
precise and efficient. These options are expected to replace the previous
options available through the line coverage feature.
In the <a href="#future-possibilities">last section</a> of this RFC, we will also discuss
the requirements for a potential integration of this coverage feature with the
LLVM toolchain.</p>
<h2 id="user-experience"><a class="header" href="#user-experience">User Experience</a></h2>
<p>The proposed experience is partially inspired by that of the most popular
coverage frameworks.
First, let us delve into the LLVM coverage workflow, followed by an explanation
of our proposal.</p>
<h3 id="the-llvm-code-coverage-workflow"><a class="header" href="#the-llvm-code-coverage-workflow">The LLVM code coverage workflow</a></h3>
<p>The LLVM project is home to one of the most popular code coverage frameworks.
The workflow associated to the LLVM framework is described in the documentation for
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html">source-based code coverage</a><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#note-source">1</a></sup>,
but we briefly describe it here to better relate it with our proposal.</p>
<p>In short, the LLVM code coverage workflow follows three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Compiling with coverage enabled.</strong> This causes the compiler to generate an instrumented program.</li>
<li><strong>Running the instrumented program.</strong> This generates binary-encoded <code>.profraw</code> files.</li>
<li><strong>Using tools to aggregate and export coverage information into other formats.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When working in a <code>cargo</code> project, step 1 can be done through this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">RUSTFLAGS='-Cinstrument-coverage' cargo build
</code></pre>
<p>The same flag must to be used for step 2:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">RUSTFLAGS='-Cinstrument-coverage' cargo run
</code></pre>
<p>This should populate the directory with at least one <code>.profraw</code> file.
Each <code>.profraw</code> file corresponds to a specific source code file in your project.</p>
<p>At this point, we will have produced the artifacts that we generally require for
the LLVM tools:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The instrumented binary</strong> which, in addition to the instrumented program,
contains additional information (e.g., the coverage mappings) required to
interpret the profiling results.</li>
<li><strong>The <code>.profraw</code> files</strong> which essentially includes the profiling results
(e.g., counter values) for each function of the corresponding source code file.</li>
</ol>
<p>For step 3, the commands will depend on what kind of results we want.
Most likely we will have to merge the <code>.profraw</code> files and produce a <code>.profdata</code>
file as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">llvm-profdata merge -sparse *.profraw -o output.profdata
</code></pre>
<p>The resulting <code>.profdata</code> file will contain the aggregated coverage results from
the <code>.profraw</code> files passed to the <code>merge</code> command.</p>
<p>Then, we can use a command such as</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">llvm-cov show target/debug/binary —instr-profile=output.profdata -show-line-counts-or-regions
</code></pre>
<p>to visualize the code coverage through the terminal as in the image:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/model-checking/kani/assets/73246657/4f8a973d-8977-4c0b-822d-e73ed6d223aa" alt="Source-based code coverage with llvm-cov" /></p>
<p>or the command</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">llvm-cov report target/debug/binary --instr-profile=output.profdata --show-region-summary
</code></pre>
<p>to produce coverage summaries like this:</p>
<pre><code>Filename                                             Regions    Missed Regions     Cover   Functions  Missed Functions  Executed       Lines      Missed Lines     Cover    Branches   Missed Branches     Cover

<p>The LLVM project refers to their own coverage feature as
<em>source-based code coverage</em>. It is not rare to see the term <em>region
coverage</em> being used instead to refer to the same thing. That is because
LLVM's source-based code coverage feature can report coverage for code
regions, but other coverage frameworks do not support the concept of code
regions.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="the-kani-coverage-workflow"><a class="header" href="#the-kani-coverage-workflow">The Kani coverage workflow</a></h3>
<p>The two main components of the Kani coverage workflow that we propose are the
following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The existing <code>--coverage</code> flag that drives the coverage workflow in Kani,
emits raw coverage data (as in the <code>.profraw</code> files), and produces basic
coverage results by default.</li>
<li>A new subcommand <code>cov</code> that allows users to further process raw coverage
information emitted by Kani to produce customized coverage results (i.e.,
different to the ones produced by default with the <code>--coverage</code> option).
The <code>cov</code> subcommand is an alias for the <code>kani-cov</code> tool.</li>
</ol>
<p>In contrast to the LLVM workflow, where human-readable coverage results can
be produced only after a sequence of LLVM tool commands, we provide some
coverage results by default.
This aligns better with our UX philosophy, and removes the need for a wrapper
around our coverage features like
<a href="https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov"><code>cargo-llvm-cov</code></a>.
Alternatively, the <code>cov</code> subcommand offers the ability of producing more
specific coverage results if needed.
We anticipate the <code>cov</code> subcommand being particularly useful in less standard
project setups, giving the users the flexibility required to produce coverage
results tailored to their specific needs.</p>
<p>In the following, we describe each one of these components in more detail.</p>
<h4 id="the---coverage-option"><a class="header" href="#the---coverage-option">The <code>--coverage</code> option</a></h4>
<p>The default coverage workflow will be kicked off through the unstable
<code>--coverage</code> option:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo kani --coverage -Zsource-coverage
</code></pre>
<p>The main difference with respect to the regular verification workflow is that,
at the end of the verification-based coverage run, Kani will generate two coverage
results:</p>
<ul>
<li>A coverage summary corresponding to the coverage achieved by the harnesses
included in the verification run. This summary will be printed after the
verification output.</li>
<li>A coverage report corresponding to the coverage achieved by the harnesses
included in the verification run. The report will be placed in the same target
directory where the raw coverage files are put. The path to the report will
also be printed after the verification output.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, a typical <code>--coverage</code> run could look like this:</p>
<pre><code>VERIFICATION:- SUCCESSFUL

Coverage Results:

| Filename | Regions | Missed Regions | Cover | Functions | Missed Functions | Cover |
| -------- | ------- | -------------- | ----- | --------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| main.rs  |       9 |              3 | 66.67 |         3 |                1 | 33.33 |
| file.rs  |      11 |              5 | 45.45 |         2 |                1 | 50.00 |

Coverage report available in target/kani/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/cov/kani_2024-04-26_15-30-00/report/index.html
</code></pre>
<h4 id="the-cov-subcommand"><a class="header" href="#the-cov-subcommand">The <code>cov</code> subcommand</a></h4>
<p>The <code>cov</code> subcommand will be used to process raw coverage information generated
by Kani and produce coverage outputs as indicated by the user.
Hence, the <code>cov</code> subcommand corresponds to the set of LLVM tools
(<code>llvm-profdata</code>, <code>llvm-cov</code>, etc.) that are used to produce coverage outputs
through the LLVM coverage workflow.</p>
<p>In contrast to LLVM, we will have a single subcommand for all Kani
coverage-related needs. The <code>cov</code> subcommand will just call the <code>kani-cov</code> tool,
which is expected to be shipped along the rest of Kani binaries.</p>
<p>We suggest that the subcommand initially offers two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>An option to merge the coverage results from one or more files and coverage
mappings<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#note-snapshot">2</a></sup> into a single file.</li>
<li>An option to produce coverage outputs from coverage results, including summaries
or coverage reports in human-readable formats (e.g., HTML).</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's assume that we have run <code>cargo kani --coverage -Zsource-coverage</code> and
generated coverage files in the <code>my-coverage</code> folder. Then, we would use <code>cargo kani cov</code> as follows to combine the coverage results<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#note-exclude">3</a></sup> for all
harnesses:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo kani cov --merge my-coverage/*.kaniraw -o my-coverage.kanicov
</code></pre>
<p>Let's say the user is first interested in reading a coverage summary through the
terminal.
They can use the <code>--summary</code> option for that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo kani cov --summary my-coverage/default.kanimap -instr-profile=my-coverage.kanicov
</code></pre>
<p>The command could print a coverage summary like:</p>
<pre><code>| Filename | Regions | Missed Regions | Cover | Functions | ...
| -------- | ------- | -------------- | ----- | --------- | ...
| main.rs  |       9 |              3 | 66.67 |         3 | ...
[...]
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's say the user wants to produce an HTML report of the coverage results.
They will have to use the <code>--report</code> option for that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo kani cov --report my-coverage/default.kanimap -format=html -instr-profile=my-coverage.kanicov -o coverage-report
</code></pre>
<p>This time, the command will generate a <code>coverage-report</code> folder including a
browsable HTML webpage that highlights the regions covered in the source
according to the coverage results in <code>my-coverage.kanicov</code>.</p>

<h4 id="integration-with-the-kani-vs-code-extension"><a class="header" href="#integration-with-the-kani-vs-code-extension">Integration with the Kani VS Code Extension</a></h4>
<p>We will update the coverage feature of the
<a href="https://github.com/model-checking/kani-vscode-extension">Kani VS Code Extension</a>
to follow this new coverage workflow.
In other words, the extension will first run Kani with the <code>--coverage</code> option and
use <code>kani cov</code> to produce a <code>.kanicov</code> file with the coverage results.
The extension will consume the source-based code coverage results and
highlight region coverage in the source code seen from VS Code.</p>
<p>We could also consider other coverage-related features in order to enhance the
experience through the Kani VS Code Extension. For example, we could
automatically show the percentage of covered regions in the status bar by
additionally extracting a summary of the coverage results.</p>
<p>Finally, we could also consider an integration with other code coverage tools.
For example, if we wanted to integrate with the VS Code extensions
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=markis.code-coverage">Code Coverage</a> or
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryanluker.vscode-coverage-gutters">Coverage Gutters</a>,
we would only need to extend <code>kani-cov</code> to export coverage results to the LCOV
format or integrate Kani with LLVM tools as discussed in <a href="#integration-with-llvm">Integration with LLVM</a>.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-design"><a class="header" href="#detailed-design">Detailed Design</a></h2>
<p>In this section, we provide more details on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Rust coverage instrumentation and how it can be integrated into
Kani to produce source-based code coverage results.</li>
<li>The proposed coverage workflow to be run by default in Kani when the
<code>--coverage</code> option is used.</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is mostly intended as a reference for Kani contributors.
Currently, the Rust coverage instrumentation continues to be developed. Because
of that, Rust toolchain upgrades may result in breaking changes to our own
coverage feature. This section should help developers to understand the general
approach and resolve such issues by themselves.</p>
<h3 id="the-rust-coverage-instrumentation"><a class="header" href="#the-rust-coverage-instrumentation">The Rust coverage instrumentation</a></h3>
<p>The Rust compiler includes two code coverage implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li>A source-based coverage implementation which uses LLVM's coverage
instrumentation to generate precise coverage data. This implementation can be
enabled with <code>-C instrument-coverage</code>.</li>
<li>A Gcov-based coverage implementation that derives coverage data based on
DebugInfo. This implementation can be enabled with <code>-Z profile</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/instrument-coverage.html">Instrumentation-based Code Coverage</a>
chapter from the <code>rustc</code> book describes in detail how to enable and use the LLVM
instrumentation-based coverage feature. In contrast, the
<a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/llvm-coverage-instrumentation.html">LLVM Source-Based Code Coverage</a>
chapter from the <code>rustc</code> development guide documents how the LLVM
coverage instrumentation is performed in the Rust compiler.</p>
<p>In this section, we will first summarize some information from the
<a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/llvm-coverage-instrumentation.html">LLVM Source-Based Code Coverage</a>
chapter, limited to details which are relevant to the development of the
source-based coverage feature in Kani. Then, we will explain how Kani taps into
the Rust coverage instrumentation to perform its own coverage instrumentation
and be able to report source-based code coverage results. This will also include
mentions to current issues with this implementation, which we plan to further
discuss in <a href="#future-possibilities">Future possibilities</a>.</p>
<h4 id="understanding-the-rust-coverage-instrumentation"><a class="header" href="#understanding-the-rust-coverage-instrumentation">Understanding the Rust coverage instrumentation</a></h4>
<p>The LLVM coverage instrumentation is implemented in the Rust compiler as a
<a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/llvm-coverage-instrumentation.html#mir-pass-instrumentcoverage">MIR pass called <code>InstrumentCoverage</code></a>.</p>
<p>The MIR pass first builds a coverage-specific version of the MIR Control Flow
Graph (CFG) from the MIR. The initial version of this CFG is based on the MIR's
<code>BasicBlock</code>s, which then gets refined by combining blocks that can be chained
from a coverage-relevant point of view. The final version of the coverage CFG is
then used to determine where to inject the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/enum.StatementKind.html#variant.Coverage"><code>StatementKind::Coverage</code></a>
statements in order to measure coverage for a single region coverage span.</p>
<p>The injection of <code>StatementKind::Coverage</code> statements is the main result we are
interested in for the integration with Kani. Additionally, the instrumentation
will also attach the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/coverage/struct.FunctionCoverageInfo.html"><code>FunctionCoverageInfo</code></a>
structure to each function's body.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#note-coverage-info">5</a></sup>
This result is also needed at the moment because coverage statements do not
include information on the code region they are supposed to cover.
However, <code>FunctionCoverageInfo</code> contains the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/coverage/struct.Mapping.html">coverage mappings</a>,
which represent the relation between
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/coverage/enum.CovTerm.html">coverage counters</a>
and code regions.</p>
<p>As explained in <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/llvm-coverage-instrumentation.html#mir-pass-instrumentcoverage">MIR Pass:
<code>InstrumentCoverage</code></a>,
many coverage statements will not be converted into a physical
counter<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#note-physical-counter">6</a></sup>. Instead, they will be converted into a
<em>coverage-counter expression</em> that can be calculated based on other coverage
counters. We highly recommend looking at the example in <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/llvm-coverage-instrumentation.html#mir-pass-instrumentcoverage">MIR Pass:
<code>InstrumentCoverage</code></a>
to better understand how this works. This optimization is mainly done for
performance reasons because incrementing a physical counter causes a
non-negligible overhead, especially within loops.</p>
<p>The (<code>StatementKind::</code>)<code>Coverage</code> statements that are injected by the Rust coverage
instrumentation contain a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/coverage/enum.CoverageKind.html"><code>CoverageKind</code></a> field indicating the type of coverage counter. The variant
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/coverage/enum.CoverageKind.html#variant.CounterIncrement"><code>CounterIncrement</code></a>
represents physical counters, while
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/coverage/enum.CoverageKind.html#variant.ExpressionUsed"><code>ExpressionUsed</code></a>
represents the counter expressions that we just discussed.
Other variants such as <code>SpanMarker</code> or <code>BlockMarker</code> are not relevant to this
work since they should have been erased after the <code>InstrumentCoverage</code> pass.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="note-coverage-info"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">5</sup>
<p>It is important to note that the <code>rustc_public</code> interface does
not include <code>FunctionCoverageInfo</code> in function bodies. Because of that, we
need to pull it from the internal <code>rustc</code> function bodies.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="note-physical-counter"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">6</sup>
<p>By <em>physical counter</em>, we refer to a global program
variable that is initialized to zero and incremented by one each time that
the execution passes through.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="integrating-the-instrumentation-into-kani"><a class="header" href="#integrating-the-instrumentation-into-kani">Integrating the instrumentation into Kani</a></h4>
<p>Now that we have explained what the Rust coverage instrumentation does at a high
level, we should be ready to discuss how it can be used from Kani. Here, we will
follow an approach where, during the codegen stage, we generate a Kani
reachability check for each code region and, after the verification stage, we
postprocess the information in those checks to generate the coverage
information. So this section will essentially be a retelling of the
implementation in <a href="https://github.com/model-checking/kani/pull/3119">#3119</a>, and
we will discuss variations/extensions of this approach in the
<a href="#rationale-and-alternatives">appropriate</a> <a href="#future-possibilities">sections</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly, the first step is adding <code>-C instrument-coverage</code> to the <code>rustc</code> flags
we use when calling the compiler to codegen. This flag enables the Rust coverage
instrumentation that we discussed earlier, resulting in</p>
<ol>
<li>the injection of
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/enum.StatementKind.html#variant.Coverage"><code>Coverage</code></a>
statements in the MIR code, and</li>
<li>the inclusion of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/coverage/struct.FunctionCoverageInfo.html"><code>FunctionCoverageInfo</code></a> in function bodies.</li>
</ol>
<p>The next step is handling the <code>Coverage</code> statements from <code>codegen_statement</code>.</p>
<p>Each <code>Coverage</code> statement contains opaque coverage
information<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#note-opaque-coverage">7</a></sup> of the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/coverage/enum.CoverageKind.html"><code>CoverageKind</code></a>
type which can be processed to determine the type of coverage counter
(<code>CounterIncrement</code> for physical counters, <code>ExpressionUsed</code> for counter
expressions) and the ID number of the counter. These two pieces of information allow us to
uniquely identify the counter within a given function. For example,
<code>CounterIncrement(0)</code> would generally refer to the first physical counter in the
function.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the <code>CoverageKind</code> information does not tell us anything about
the code region that the counter covers. However, data about the code region can
be pulled from the coverage mappings included in the <code>FunctionCoverageInfo</code> that
is attached to the (internal) function body. Note that the coverage mappings
includes information about all the coverage counters in a function, even for
counters which have been dropped. Matching the <code>CoverageKind</code> information with
that of the counters in the coverage mappings allows us to retrieve the code
region for any counter.</p>
<p>Using all this data, for each coverage statement<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#note-expression-integration">8</a></sup> we generate a coverage check
that maintains the essence of the coverage checks described in the <a href="https://model-checking.github.io/kani/rfc/rfcs/0008-line-coverage.html">RFC for line
coverage</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coverage checks are a new class of checks similar to <a href="https://model-checking.github.io/kani/rfc/rfcs/0003-cover-statement.html"><code>cover</code> checks</a>.
The main difference is that users cannot directly interact with coverage checks (i.e., they cannot add or remove them manually).
Coverage checks are encoded as an <code>assert(false)</code> statement (to test reachability) with a fixed description.
In addition, coverage checks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hidden from verification results.</li>
<li>Postprocessed to produce coverage results.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, the last step is to postprocess the results from coverage checks to
produce coverage results. This is not too complicated to do since the checks
already include the counter information (type + ID) and the function name in
the check's description. If the span of the code region is also included
(this is what <a href="https://github.com/model-checking/kani/pull/3119">#3119</a> is
currently doing), we can directly generate a primitive output like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;file_path&gt; (&lt;function_name&gt;)
 * &lt;region_start&gt; - &lt;region_end&gt; &lt;status&gt;
 * ...
 * &lt;region_start&gt; - &lt;region_end&gt; &lt;status&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>For example, for the test case in
<a href="https://github.com/model-checking/kani/pull/3119">#3119</a> we report this:</p>
<pre><code>src/main.rs (main)
 * 14:1 - 19:2 COVERED

src/main.rs (test_cov)
 * 5:1 - 6:15 COVERED
 * 6:19 - 6:28 UNCOVERED
 * 7:9 - 7:13 COVERED
 * 9:9 - 9:14 UNCOVERED
 * 11:1 - 11:2 COVERED
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE: This section has been written according to the implementation in
<a href="https://github.com/model-checking/kani/pull/3119">#3119</a>, which currently
produces a text-based output like the one shown above. There is ongoing work to
store the coverage mappings in a separate file (as described in the next
section), which would save us the need to attach code region data to the
coverage checks.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="note-opaque-coverage"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">7</sup>
<p>The Rust compiler uses the <code>Opaque</code> type to prevent
others from interfacing with unstable types (e.g., the <code>Coverage</code> type
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/f7eefec4e03f5ba723fbc04d94dbc1203b7c9bff/compiler/stable_mir/src/mir/body.rs#L389">here</a>).
Nonetheless, this can be worked around by serializing its contents and parsing
it back into an internal data type.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="note-expression-integration"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">8</sup>
<p>We could follow an alternative approach where we
do not instrument each coverage statement, but only those that correspond to
physical counters. Unfortunately, doing so would lead to incorrect coverage
results due to the arithmetic nature of expression-based counters. We elaborate
on this topic in the later parts of this document.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="the-default-coverage-workflow-in-kani"><a class="header" href="#the-default-coverage-workflow-in-kani">The default coverage workflow in Kani</a></h3>
<p>In this section, we describe the default <code>--coverage</code> workflow from a
developer's point of view. This will hopefully help developers understand how
the different coverage components in Kani are connected. For example, we'll
describe the raw coverage information that gets produced throughout the default
<code>--coverage</code> workflow and define the basic <code>cov</code> commands that it will execute.</p>
<p>The main difference with respect to the regular verification workflow is that,
at the end of the verification-based coverage run, Kani will generate two types
of files:</p>
<ul>
<li>One single file <code>.kanimap</code> file for the project. This file will contain the
coverage mappings for the project's source code.</li>
<li>One <code>.kaniraw</code> file for each harness. This file will contain the
verification-based results for the coverage-oriented properties corresponding
to a given harness.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <code>.kaniraw</code> files correspond to <code>.profraw</code> files in the LLVM coverage
workflow. Similarly, the <code>.kanimap</code> file corresponds to the coverage-related
information that's embedded into the project's binaries in the LLVM coverage
workflow.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#note-kanimap">9</a></sup></p>
<p>The files will be written into a new timestamped directory associated with the
coverage run. The path to this directory will be printed to standard output in
by default. For example, the <a href="https://github.com/model-checking/kani/pull/3119">draft implementation</a>
writes the coverage files into the <code>target/kani/&lt;target_triple&gt;/cov/</code> directory.</p>
<p>Users aren't expected to read the information in any of these files.
Therefore, there's no need to restrict their format.
The <a href="https://github.com/model-checking/kani/pull/3119">draft implementation</a>
uses the JSON format but we might consider using a binary format if it doesn't
scale.</p>
<p>In addition, Kani will produce two types of coverage results:</p>
<ol>
<li>A coverage summary with the default options.</li>
<li>A terminal-based coverage report with the default options. However, we will
only do this if the program is composed of a single source
file<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#note-conditional-report">10</a></sup>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="note-kanimap"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">9</sup>
<p>Note that the <code>.kanimap</code> generation isn't implemented in
<a href="https://github.com/model-checking/kani/pull/3119">#3119</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/model-checking/kani/pull/3121">draft
implementation of
<code>kani-cov</code></a> simply reads
the source files referred to by the code coverage checks, but it doesn't get
information about code trimmed out by the MIR linker.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="note-conditional-report"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">10</sup>
<p>In other words, standalone <code>kani</code> would always emit
these terminal-based reports, but <code>cargo kani</code> would not unless the project
contains a single Rust file (for example, <code>src/main.rs</code>).</p>

At the moment, there's only another unstable, GCC-compatible code coverage implementation
based on the Gcov format. The Gcov format is line-based so it's not able
to report region coverage results.

<h2 id="future-possibilities"><a class="header" href="#future-possibilities">Future possibilities</a></h2>
<h3 id="integration-with-llvm"><a class="header" href="#integration-with-llvm">Integration with LLVM</a></h3>
<p>As part of this work, we explored a potential integration with the LLVM
framework. The idea behind such an integration would essentially involve
producing coverage results in formats compatible with the LLVM framework (e.g.,
the <code>.profraw</code> format). The main advantage of integrating with the LLVM
framework in this way is that we would not need a tool like <code>kani-cov</code> to
aggregate coverage results; we could just use LLVM tools such as <code>llvm-profdata</code>
and <code>llvm-cov</code> to consume them.</p>
<p>However, at this time we recommend against integrating with LLVM due to these reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generating the instrumented binary used in the <a href="#the-llvm-code-coverage-workflow">LLVM coverage
workflow</a> requires a standard <code>rustc</code>
compilation with <code>--cfg kani</code> in addition to other flags including <code>-C instrument-coverage</code>. This is likely to result in compilation errors since the
standard <code>rustc</code> backend cannot produce code for Kani APIs, for example.</li>
<li>Producing the <code>.profraw</code> files requires executing the instrumented binary at
least once. This would be an issue for Rust projects which assume a particular
environment for their execution.</li>
<li>There are no stable interfaces to create or modify files in formats
compatible with the LLVM framework. Even though the documentation for the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CoverageMappingFormat.html">LLVM
Code Coverage Mapping Format</a>
is excellent, the easiest way to interact with files on these format is through
LLVM tools (e.g.,
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/llvm/tools/llvm-cov"><code>llvm-cov</code></a>)
which bring in many other LLVM dependencies. During our exploration, we
attempted to decode and re-encode files in the <code>.profraw</code> to set the counter
data to the values obtained during verification. To this end, we tried tools
like <a href="https://github.com/xd009642/llvm-profparser/"><code>llvm-profparser</code></a> which
can be used as a replacement for <code>llvm-profdata</code> and <code>llvm-cov</code> but failed to
parse coverage files emitted by the Rust compiler (this is also related to the
next point). Another crate that we used is
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/coverage-dump"><code>coverage-dump</code></a>,
a recent tool in the Rust compiler used for testing purposes. <code>coverage-dump</code>
extracts coverage mappings from LLVM IR assembly files (i.e., human-readable
<code>*.ll</code> files) but does not work with the binary-encoded formats. Finally, we
also built some ad-hoc tooling to perform these modifications but it soon
became evident that we would need to develop it further in order to handle any
program.</li>
<li>LLVM releases a new version approximately every six months. This would
likely result in another &quot;toolchain update&quot; problem for Kani in order to
provide compatibility with newer LLVM versions. Moreover, the Rust compiler
supplies their own version of LLVM tools (<code>rust-profdata</code>, <code>rust-cov</code>, etc.)
which are fully compatible with coverage-related artifacts produced by <code>rustc</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="optimization-with-coverage-counter-expressions"><a class="header" href="#optimization-with-coverage-counter-expressions">Optimization with coverage-counter expressions</a></h3>
<p>In the <a href="#integrating-the-instrumentation-into-kani">subsection related to the
integration</a>, we noted that we could
follow an alternative approach where we only instrument coverage statements that
correspond to physical counters. In fact, this would be the logical choice since
the replacement of physical counters by expression-based counters would also be
a performance optimization for us.</p>
<p>However, the expressions used in expression-based counters are built with the
arithmetic operators <code>Add</code> (<code>+</code>) and <code>Sub</code> (<code>-</code>). On the other hand, the
coverage checks performed by Kani have a boolean meaning: you either cover a
region or you do not. Thus, there are many cases where these two notions of
coverage counters are incompatible. For example, let's say we have this
function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn check_value(val: u32) {
   if val == VALUE {
      do_this();
   } else {
      do_that();
   }
   do_something_else();
}
</code></pre>
<p>One way to optimize the counters in this function is to have two physical
counters for the branches of the <code>if</code> statement (<code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code>), and then an
expression-based counter associated to the <code>do_something_else()</code> statement
adding those (i.e., <code>c3 = c1 + c2</code>). If we have, for example, two executions for
this program, with each one taking a different branch, then the results for the
coverage counters will be <code>c1 = 1</code>, <code>c2 = 1</code> and <code>c3 = c1 + c2 = 2</code>.</p>
<p>But what does <code>c3 = 2</code> mean in the context of a verification-based coverage
result? That is not clear. For instance, in a Kani trace, you could have a
nondeterministic value for <code>val</code> which just happens to be <code>val == VALUE</code> and not
at the same time. This would result in the same counters (<code>c1 = 1</code>, <code>c2 = 1</code> and
<code>c3 = 2</code>), but the program is being run only once!</p>
<p>Note that finding a verification-based replacement for the runtime operators in
counter-based expressions is an interesting research topic. If we could
establish a relation between the runtime and verification expressions, then we
could avoid the instrumentation of coverage checks for expression-based
counters. For example, could we replace the <code>Add</code> operator (<code>+</code>) with an <code>Or</code>
operator (<code>||</code>)? Intuitively, this makes sense since verification-based coverage
counters are binary. It also seems to work for our example since covering any of
the branches should result in the <code>do_something_else()</code> statement being covered
as well, with the counter values now being <code>c1 = 1</code>, <code>c2 = 1</code> and <code>c3 = 1</code>.
However, it is not clear that this would work for all cases, nor it is clear
that we can replace <code>Sub</code> with another verification-based operator.</p>
