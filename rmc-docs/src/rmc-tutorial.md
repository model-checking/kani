# RMC tutorial

This tutorial will step you through a reasonable progression from simple to moderately complex tasks with RMC.
It's meant to ensure you can get started, and see at least some simple examples of how typical proofs are structured.

1. [Begin with RMC installation.](./install-guide.md) This will take through to running `rmc` on your first Rust program.
2. Consider reading our [tool comparison](./tool-comparison.md) to understand what RMC is.
3. Coming soon.
4. Consider returning to the [tool comparison](./tool-comparison.md) after trying the tutorial to see if any of the abstract ideas have become more concrete.
