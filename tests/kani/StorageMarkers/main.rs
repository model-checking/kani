/// A reference to a node.
///
/// This type has a number of parameters that controls how it acts:
/// - `BorrowType`: A dummy type that describes the kind of borrow and carries a lifetime.
///    - When this is `Immut<'a>`, the `NodeRef` acts roughly like `&'a Node`.
///    - When this is `ValMut<'a>`, the `NodeRef` acts roughly like `&'a Node`
///      with respect to keys and tree structure, but also allows many
///      mutable references to values throughout the tree to coexist.
///    - When this is `Mut<'a>`, the `NodeRef` acts roughly like `&'a mut Node`,
///      although insert methods allow a mutable pointer to a value to coexist.
///    - When this is `Owned`, the `NodeRef` acts roughly like `Box<Node>`,
///      but does not have a destructor, and must be cleaned up manually.
///    - When this is `Dying`, the `NodeRef` still acts roughly like `Box<Node>`,
///      but has methods to destroy the tree bit by bit, and ordinary methods,
///      while not marked as unsafe to call, can invoke UB if called incorrectly.
///   Since any `NodeRef` allows navigating through the tree, `BorrowType`
///   effectively applies to the entire tree, not just to the node itself.
/// - `K` and `V`: These are the types of keys and values stored in the nodes.
/// - `Type`: This can be `Leaf`, `Internal`, or `LeafOrInternal`. When this is
///   `Leaf`, the `NodeRef` points to a leaf node, when this is `Internal` the
///   `NodeRef` points to an internal node, and when this is `LeafOrInternal` the
///   `NodeRef` could be pointing to either type of node.
///   `Type` is named `NodeType` when used outside `NodeRef`.
///
/// Both `BorrowType` and `NodeType` restrict what methods we implement, to
/// exploit static type safety. There are limitations in the way we can apply
/// such restrictions:
/// - For each type parameter, we can only define a method either generically
///   or for one particular type. For example, we cannot define a method like
///   `into_kv` generically for all `BorrowType`, or once for all types that
///   carry a lifetime, because we want it to return `&'a` references.
///   Therefore, we define it only for the least powerful type `Immut<'a>`.
/// - We cannot get implicit coercion from say `Mut<'a>` to `Immut<'a>`.
///   Therefore, we have to explicitly call `reborrow` on a more powerful
///   `NodeRef` in order to reach a method like `into_kv`.
///
/// All methods on `NodeRef` that return some kind of reference, either:
/// - Take `self` by value, and return the lifetime carried by `BorrowType`.
///   Sometimes, to invoke such a method, we need to call `reborrow_mut`.
/// - Take `self` by reference, and (implicitly) return that reference's
///   lifetime, instead of the lifetime carried by `BorrowType`. That way,
///   the borrow checker guarantees that the `NodeRef` remains borrowed as long
///   as the returned reference is used.
///   The methods supporting insert bend this rule by returning a raw pointer,
///   i.e., a reference without any lifetime.
