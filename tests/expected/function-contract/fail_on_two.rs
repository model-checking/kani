//! The test cases try to ensure applying the hypothesis is only done in
//! inductive verification of a function call. E.g. on every second encounter of
//! the called function in its own call stack rather than globally in the
//! program.
//!
//! In each case we have a recursive function that is called and we expect that
//! the recursive call within the first call has the hypothesis applied. (That's
//! not actually tested here but separately.)
//!
//! Then we call the function again and we've set up the cases such that *if*
//! the actual body is used then that call with fail (once because of panic,
//! once because the postcondition is violated). If instead the hypothesis (e.g.
//! contract replacement) is used we'd expect the verification to succeed.
