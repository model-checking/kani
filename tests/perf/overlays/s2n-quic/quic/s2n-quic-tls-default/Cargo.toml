[features]
# The [`?`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html?highlight=addative#dependency-features)
# syntax only enables `fips` for `s2n-quic-tls` if something else enables `s2n-quic-tls`. This
# preserves the selective compilation of the two tls crates.
fips = ["s2n-quic-tls?/fips"]

# Declare `s2n-quic-tls` as an optional dependency since the `?` syntax for features requires
# the dependency be optional.
#
# It is not possible to enable a feature flag based on target since Cargo currently doesn't
# support platform specific feature flags: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1197. In
# order to support the `?` syntax, we declare s2n-quic-tls as an optional dependency.
# `s2n-quic-tls` only gets enabled based on the target.
