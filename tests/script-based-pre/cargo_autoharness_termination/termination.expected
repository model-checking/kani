Autoharness: Checking function timeout::check_harness_timeout against all possible inputs...
CBMC failed
VERIFICATION:- FAILED
CBMC timed out. You may want to rerun your proof with a larger timeout or use stubbing to reduce the size of the code the verifier reasons about.

Autoharness: Checking function unwind_bound::gcd_recursion against all possible inputs...
Not unwinding recursion unwind_bound::gcd_recursion iteration 21

unwind_bound::gcd_recursion.assertion\
	 - Status: FAILURE\
	 - Description: "attempt to calculate the remainder with a divisor of zero"

unwind_bound::gcd_recursion.recursion\
	 - Status: FAILURE\
	 - Description: "recursion unwinding assertion"

VERIFICATION:- FAILED
[Kani] info: Verification output shows one or more unwinding failures.

Autoharness: Checking function unwind_bound::infinite_loop against all possible inputs...
unwind_bound::infinite_loop.unwind\
	 - Status: FAILURE\
	 - Description: "unwinding assertion loop 0"

VERIFICATION:- FAILED
[Kani] info: Verification output shows one or more unwinding failures.

Autoharness Summary:
Also note that Kani sets default --harness-timeout of 30s and --default-unwind of 20.
If verification failed because of timing out or too low of an unwinding bound, try passing larger values for these arguments (or, if possible, writing a loop contract).
Verification failed for - timeout::check_harness_timeout
Verification failed for - unwind_bound::gcd_recursion
Verification failed for - unwind_bound::infinite_loop
Complete - 0 successfully verified functions, 3 failures, 3 total.
