Kani generated automatic harnesses for 1 function(s):
+-----------------------+
| Selected Function     |
+=======================+
| check_harness_timeout |
+-----------------------+

Skipped Functions: None. Kani generated automatic harnesses for all functions in the available crate(s).
Autoharness: Checking function check_harness_timeout against all possible inputs...
CBMC failed
VERIFICATION:- FAILED
CBMC timed out. You may want to rerun your proof with a larger timeout or use stubbing to reduce the size of the code the verifier reasons about.

Manual Harness Summary:
No proof harnesses (functions with #[kani::proof]) were found to verify.

Autoharness Summary:
+-----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------+
| Selected Function     | Kind of Automatic Harness | Verification Result |
+=========================================================================+
| check_harness_timeout | #[kani::proof]            | Failure             |
+-----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------+
Note that `kani autoharness` sets default --harness-timeout of 60s and --default-unwind of 20.
If verification failed because of timing out or too low of an unwinding bound, try passing larger values for these arguments (or, if possible, writing a loop contract).
