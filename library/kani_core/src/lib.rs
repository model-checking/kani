            //! Given the following validity rules provided in the Rust documentation:
            //! <https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ptr/index.html> (accessed Feb 6th, 2024)
            //!
            //! 1. A null pointer is never valid, not even for accesses of size zero.
            //! 2. For a pointer to be valid, it is necessary, but not always sufficient, that the pointer
            //!    be dereferenceable: the memory range of the given size starting at the pointer must all be
            //!    within the bounds of a single allocated object. Note that in Rust, every (stack-allocated)
            //!    variable is considered a separate allocated object.
            //!    ~~Even for operations of size zero, the pointer must not be pointing to deallocated memory,
            //!    i.e., deallocation makes pointers invalid even for zero-sized operations.~~
            //!    ZST access is not OK for any pointer.
            //!    See: <https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/472>
            //! 3. However, casting any non-zero integer literal to a pointer is valid for zero-sized
            //!    accesses, even if some memory happens to exist at that address and gets deallocated.
            //!    This corresponds to writing your own allocator: allocating zero-sized objects is not very
            //!    hard. The canonical way to obtain a pointer that is valid for zero-sized accesses is
            //!    `NonNull::dangling`.
            //! 4. All accesses performed by functions in this module are non-atomic in the sense of atomic
            //!    operations used to synchronize between threads.
            //!    This means it is undefined behavior to perform two concurrent accesses to the same location
            //!    from different threads unless both accesses only read from memory.
            //!    Notice that this explicitly includes `read_volatile` and `write_volatile`:
            //!    Volatile accesses cannot be used for inter-thread synchronization.
            //! 5. The result of casting a reference to a pointer is valid for as long as the underlying
            //!    object is live and no reference (just raw pointers) is used to access the same memory.
            //!    That is, reference and pointer accesses cannot be interleaved.
            //!
            //! Kani is able to verify #1 and #2 today.
            //!
            //! For #3, we are overly cautious, and Kani will only consider zero-sized pointer access safe if
            //! the address matches `NonNull::<()>::dangling()`.
            //! The way Kani tracks provenance is not enough to check if the address was the result of a cast
            //! from a non-zero integer literal.
