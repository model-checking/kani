// CVec is an abstraction of the Vector library which is implemented as a Rust-based
// frontend and a C based backend. All public facing methods here are implemented
// as wrappers around FFI functions which call into methods implemented in C. There
// were multiple reasons as to why this abstractions was conceived:
//
// 1. Reduce the cost of translation: Kani translates Rust code into equivalent
// gotoC representation which is used for verification with CBMC. However, this
// might introduce additional overhead due to nesting of calls, monomorphization,
// handling generics, etc. CVec gets around that issue by making direct calls
// to the C implementation. This is usually hard to reason about for most other
// frameworks since they are unable to handle unsafe code. But because of the
// way Kani works, it is almost zero cost to achieve this.
//
// 2. Leverage CBMC primitives: Some CBMC primitives cannot yet be correctly
// translated/handled by Kani, for instance: __CPROVER_constant_infinity_uint. If
// there are improvements in CBMC, a quick way to test their applicability in
// Kani would be to work with this abstraction and perform experiments.

// A c_vec consists of a pointer to allocated memory, the capacity of the allocation and
// the length of the vector to be used in verification. This structure is also
// defined in c_vec and is used across the FFI boundary.
//
// An important callout to make here is that this structure is currently only defined
// to work with a Vec<u32>. This code was meant to experiment with and demonstrate
// the ability to work with CBMCs C interface.

// All of the functions below call into implementations defined in vec.c
//
// We could also move to a more polished definition which is defined in a .h header
// file which is what this interface would need to care about. For now, the
// definition and the implementation reside in vec.c.
//
// Although these are defined manually, it might be worthwhile to look at projects
// such as cbindgen which can generate automatically generate headers for Rust
// code which exposes a public interface. For instance, we could define generic
// Vector representations and have the framework generate headers for us which we
// can then implement. In that case, we would have to implement the C backend in
// such a way that it can handle types of arbitrary sizes by casting memory blocks
// and Vector elements and treating them as such.
