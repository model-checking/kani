// Currently, the way we handle non-determinism is to implement a __nondet::<T>::()
// function which is stubbed to be `unimplemented!()`. However, at a later time
// it could be possible to implement a Nondet<T> trait per type. This would with
// enum types such as Option where we could decide whether we want to return
// a None or a Some(Nondet<T>). That method would likely end up in this file so
// that it can be used throughout.
