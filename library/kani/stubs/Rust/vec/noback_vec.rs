// NoBackVec implements an abstraction of the Vector library which tracks only
// the length of the vector. It does not contain a backing store which implies
// that writes only increment the length and all reads return a non-deterministic
// value.
//
// This abstraction is particularly effective for use cases where the customer
// code only cares about the length of the vector. All length queries are
// fast because the solver does not have to reason about the memory model at all.
//
// This abstraction has several limitations however. Since it does not model any
// memory, defining general methods which operate on the values of the vector is
// hard and in some cases, unsound. Please see the README.md for a more in-depth
// discussion of potential improvements to this abstraction.
//
// NOTE: It would also be difficult to soundly model a Vector where the contained
// type has a non-trivial drop method defined for it.

// __CPROVER_max_malloc_size is dependent on the number of offset bits used to
// represent a pointer variable. By default, this is chosen to be 56, in which
// case the max_malloc_size is 2 ** (offset_bits - 1). We could go as far as to
// assign the default capacity to be the max_malloc_size but that would be overkill.
// Instead, we choose a high-enough value 2 ** (31 - 1). Another reason to do
// this is that it would be easier for the solver to reason about memory if multiple
// Vectors are initialized by the abstraction consumer.
