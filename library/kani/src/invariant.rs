//! This module introduces the Invariant trait.

use crate::Arbitrary;

/// Types that implement a check to ensure its value is valid and safe to be used. See
/// <https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nomicon/what-unsafe-does.html> for examples of valid values.
///
/// Implementations of Invariant traits must ensure that the current bit values of the given type
/// is valid and that all its invariants hold.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This trait is unsafe since &self might represent an invalid value. The `is_valid()` function
/// must return `true` if and only if the invariant of its type is held.
///
/// # Deprecation
///
/// We have decided to deprecate this trait in favor of using `Arbitrary` for now. The main
/// benefit of using Invariant was to avoid calling `kani::any_raw()` followed by `kani::assume()`.
/// However, `kani::any_raw()` today cannot guarantee the rust type validity invariants, which
/// could lead to UB in our analysis.
#[deprecated(
    since = "0.8.0",
    note = "With `kani::Invariant`, Kani cannot guarantee that the type respects the language \
    type invariants which may trigger UB. Use `kani::Arbitrary` instead."
