//! # The Rust Standard Library
//!
//! The Rust Standard Library is the foundation of portable Rust software, a
//! set of minimal and battle-tested shared abstractions for the [broader Rust
//! ecosystem][crates.io]. It offers core types, like [`Vec<T>`] and
//! [`Option<T>`], library-defined [operations on language
//! primitives](#primitives), [standard macros](#macros), [I/O] and
//! [multithreading], among [many other things][other].
//!
//! `std` is available to all Rust crates by default. Therefore, the
//! standard library can be accessed in [`use`] statements through the path
//! `std`, as in [`use std::env`].
//!
//! # How to read this documentation
//!
//! If you already know the name of what you are looking for, the fastest way to
//! find it is to use the <a href="#" onclick="focusSearchBar();">search
//! bar</a> at the top of the page.
//!
//! Otherwise, you may want to jump to one of these useful sections:
//!
//! * [`std::*` modules](#modules)
//! * [Primitive types](#primitives)
//! * [Standard macros](#macros)
//! * [The Rust Prelude]
//!
//! If this is your first time, the documentation for the standard library is
//! written to be casually perused. Clicking on interesting things should
//! generally lead you to interesting places. Still, there are important bits
//! you don't want to miss, so read on for a tour of the standard library and
//! its documentation!
//!
//! Once you are familiar with the contents of the standard library you may
//! begin to find the verbosity of the prose distracting. At this stage in your
//! development you may want to press the `[-]` button near the top of the
//! page to collapse it into a more skimmable view.
//!
//! While you are looking at that `[-]` button also notice the `[src]`
//! button. Rust's API documentation comes with the source code and you are
//! encouraged to read it. The standard library source is generally high
//! quality and a peek behind the curtains is often enlightening.
//!
//! # What is in the standard library documentation?
//!
//! First of all, The Rust Standard Library is divided into a number of focused
//! modules, [all listed further down this page](#modules). These modules are
//! the bedrock upon which all of Rust is forged, and they have mighty names
//! like [`std::slice`] and [`std::cmp`]. Modules' documentation typically
//! includes an overview of the module along with examples, and are a smart
//! place to start familiarizing yourself with the library.
//!
//! Second, implicit methods on [primitive types] are documented here. This can
//! be a source of confusion for two reasons:
//!
//! 1. While primitives are implemented by the compiler, the standard library
//!    implements methods directly on the primitive types (and it is the only
//!    library that does so), which are [documented in the section on
//!    primitives](#primitives).
//! 2. The standard library exports many modules *with the same name as
//!    primitive types*. These define additional items related to the primitive
//!    type, but not the all-important methods.
//!
//! So for example there is a [page for the primitive type
//! `i32`](primitive::i32) that lists all the methods that can be called on
//! 32-bit integers (very useful), and there is a [page for the module
//! `std::i32`] that documents the constant values [`MIN`] and [`MAX`] (rarely
//! useful).
//!
//! Note the documentation for the primitives [`str`] and [`[T]`][prim@slice] (also
//! called 'slice'). Many method calls on [`String`] and [`Vec<T>`] are actually
//! calls to methods on [`str`] and [`[T]`][prim@slice] respectively, via [deref
//! coercions][deref-coercions].
//!
//! Third, the standard library defines [The Rust Prelude], a small collection
//! of items - mostly traits - that are imported into every module of every
//! crate. The traits in the prelude are pervasive, making the prelude
//! documentation a good entry point to learning about the library.
//!
//! And finally, the standard library exports a number of standard macros, and
//! [lists them on this page](#macros) (technically, not all of the standard
//! macros are defined by the standard library - some are defined by the
//! compiler - but they are documented here the same). Like the prelude, the
//! standard macros are imported by default into all crates.

//!
//! # A Tour of The Rust Standard Library
//!
//! The rest of this crate documentation is dedicated to pointing out notable
//! features of The Rust Standard Library.
//!
//! ## Containers and collections
//!
//! The [`option`] and [`result`] modules define optional and error-handling
//! types, [`Option<T>`] and [`Result<T, E>`]. The [`iter`] module defines
//! Rust's iterator trait, [`Iterator`], which works with the [`for`] loop to
//! access collections.
//!
//! The standard library exposes three common ways to deal with contiguous
//! regions of memory:
//!
//! * [`Vec<T>`] - A heap-allocated *vector* that is resizable at runtime.
//! * [`[T; N]`][prim@array] - An inline *array* with a fixed size at compile time.
//! * [`[T]`][prim@slice] - A dynamically sized *slice* into any other kind of contiguous
//!   storage, whether heap-allocated or not.
//!
//! Slices can only be handled through some kind of *pointer*, and as such come
//! in many flavors such as:
//!
//! * `&[T]` - *shared slice*
//! * `&mut [T]` - *mutable slice*
//! * [`Box<[T]>`][owned slice] - *owned slice*
//!
//! [`str`], a UTF-8 string slice, is a primitive type, and the standard library
//! defines many methods for it. Rust [`str`]s are typically accessed as
//! immutable references: `&str`. Use the owned [`String`] for building and
//! mutating strings.
//!
//! For converting to strings use the [`format!`] macro, and for converting from
//! strings use the [`FromStr`] trait.
//!
//! Data may be shared by placing it in a reference-counted box or the [`Rc`]
//! type, and if further contained in a [`Cell`] or [`RefCell`], may be mutated
//! as well as shared. Likewise, in a concurrent setting it is common to pair an
//! atomically-reference-counted box, [`Arc`], with a [`Mutex`] to get the same
//! effect.
//!
//! The [`collections`] module defines maps, sets, linked lists and other
//! typical collection types, including the common [`HashMap<K, V>`].
//!
//! ## Platform abstractions and I/O
//!
//! Besides basic data types, the standard library is largely concerned with
//! abstracting over differences in common platforms, most notably Windows and
//! Unix derivatives.
//!
//! Common types of I/O, including [files], [TCP], [UDP], are defined in the
//! [`io`], [`fs`], and [`net`] modules.
//!
//! The [`thread`] module contains Rust's threading abstractions. [`sync`]
//! contains further primitive shared memory types, including [`atomic`] and
//! [`mpsc`], which contains the channel types for message passing.
//!
//! [I/O]: io
