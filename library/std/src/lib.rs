/// This assert macro calls kani's assert function passing it down the condition
/// as well as a message that will be used when reporting the assertion result.
///
/// For the first form that does not involve a message, the macro will generate the following message:
/// assertion failed: cond
/// where `cond` is the stringified condition. For example, for
/// ```rust
/// assert!(1 + 1 == 2);
/// ```
/// the message will be:
/// assertion failed: 1 + 1 == 2
///
/// For the second form that involves a custom message possibly with arguments,
/// the macro will generate a message that is a concat of the custom message
/// along with all the arguments. For example, for
/// ```rust
/// assert!(a + b == c, "The sum of {} and {} is {}", a, b, c);
/// ```
/// the assert message will be:
/// "The sum of {} and {} is {}", 1, 1, 2
