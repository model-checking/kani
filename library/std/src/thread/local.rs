/// A thread local storage key which owns its contents.
///
/// This key uses the fastest possible implementation available to it for the
/// target platform. It is instantiated with the [`thread_local!`] macro and the
/// primary method is the [`with`] method.
///
/// The [`with`] method yields a reference to the contained value which cannot be
/// sent across threads or escape the given closure.
///
/// # Initialization and Destruction
///
/// Initialization is dynamically performed on the first call to [`with`]
/// within a thread, and values that implement [`Drop`] get destructed when a
/// thread exits. Some caveats apply, which are explained below.
///
/// A `LocalKey`'s initializer cannot recursively depend on itself, and using
/// a `LocalKey` in this way will cause the initializer to infinitely recurse
/// on the first call to `with`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::cell::RefCell;
/// use std::thread;
///
/// thread_local!(static FOO: RefCell<u32> = RefCell::new(1));
///
/// FOO.with(|f| {
///     assert_eq!(*f.borrow(), 1);
///     *f.borrow_mut() = 2;
/// });
///
/// // each thread starts out with the initial value of 1
/// let t = thread::spawn(move|| {
///     FOO.with(|f| {
///         assert_eq!(*f.borrow(), 1);
///         *f.borrow_mut() = 3;
///     });
/// });
///
/// // wait for the thread to complete and bail out on panic
/// t.join().unwrap();
///
/// // we retain our original value of 2 despite the child thread
/// FOO.with(|f| {
///     assert_eq!(*f.borrow(), 2);
/// });
/// ```
///
/// # Platform-specific behavior
///
/// Note that a "best effort" is made to ensure that destructors for types
/// stored in thread local storage are run, but not all platforms can guarantee
/// that destructors will be run for all types in thread local storage. For
/// example, there are a number of known caveats where destructors are not run:
///
/// 1. On Unix systems when pthread-based TLS is being used, destructors will
///    not be run for TLS values on the main thread when it exits. Note that the
///    application will exit immediately after the main thread exits as well.
/// 2. On all platforms it's possible for TLS to re-initialize other TLS slots
///    during destruction. Some platforms ensure that this cannot happen
///    infinitely by preventing re-initialization of any slot that has been
///    destroyed, but not all platforms have this guard. Those platforms that do
///    not guard typically have a synthetic limit after which point no more
///    destructors are run.
/// 3. When the process exits on Windows systems, TLS destructors may only be
///    run on the thread that causes the process to exit. This is because the
///    other threads may be forcibly terminated.
///
/// ## Synchronization in thread-local destructors
///
/// On Windows, synchronization operations (such as [`JoinHandle::join`]) in
/// thread local destructors are prone to deadlocks and so should be avoided.
/// This is because the [loader lock] is held while a destructor is run. The
/// lock is acquired whenever a thread starts or exits or when a DLL is loaded
/// or unloaded. Therefore these events are blocked for as long as a thread
/// local destructor is running.
///
/// [loader lock]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-best-practices
