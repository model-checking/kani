//! Native threads.
//!
//! ## The threading model
//!
//! An executing Rust program consists of a collection of native OS threads,
//! each with their own stack and local state. Threads can be named, and
//! provide some built-in support for low-level synchronization.
//!
//! Communication between threads can be done through
//! [channels], Rust's message-passing types, along with [other forms of thread
//! synchronization](../../std/sync/index.html) and shared-memory data
//! structures. In particular, types that are guaranteed to be
//! threadsafe are easily shared between threads using the
//! atomically-reference-counted container, [`Arc`].
//!
//! Fatal logic errors in Rust cause *thread panic*, during which
//! a thread will unwind the stack, running destructors and freeing
//! owned resources. While not meant as a 'try/catch' mechanism, panics
//! in Rust can nonetheless be caught (unless compiling with `panic=abort`) with
//! [`catch_unwind`](../../std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html) and recovered
//! from, or alternatively be resumed with
//! [`resume_unwind`](../../std/panic/fn.resume_unwind.html). If the panic
//! is not caught the thread will exit, but the panic may optionally be
//! detected from a different thread with [`join`]. If the main thread panics
//! without the panic being caught, the application will exit with a
//! non-zero exit code.
//!
//! When the main thread of a Rust program terminates, the entire program shuts
//! down, even if other threads are still running. However, this module provides
//! convenient facilities for automatically waiting for the termination of a
//! thread (i.e., join).
//!
//! ## Spawning a thread
//!
//! A new thread can be spawned using the [`thread::spawn`][`spawn`] function:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! thread::spawn(move || {
//!     // some work here
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! In this example, the spawned thread is "detached," which means that there is
//! no way for the program to learn when the spawned thread completes or otherwise
//! terminates.
//!
//! To learn when a thread completes, it is necessary to capture the [`JoinHandle`]
//! object that is returned by the call to [`spawn`], which provides
//! a `join` method that allows the caller to wait for the completion of the
//! spawned thread:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! let thread_join_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
//!     // some work here
//! });
//! // some work here
//! let res = thread_join_handle.join();
//! ```
//!
//! The [`join`] method returns a [`thread::Result`] containing [`Ok`] of the final
//! value produced by the spawned thread, or [`Err`] of the value given to
//! a call to [`panic!`] if the thread panicked.
//!
//! Note that there is no parent/child relationship between a thread that spawns a
//! new thread and the thread being spawned.  In particular, the spawned thread may or
//! may not outlive the spawning thread, unless the spawning thread is the main thread.
//!
//! ## Configuring threads
//!
//! A new thread can be configured before it is spawned via the [`Builder`] type,
//! which currently allows you to set the name and stack size for the thread:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #![allow(unused_must_use)]
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! thread::Builder::new().name("thread1".to_string()).spawn(move || {
//!     println!("Hello, world!");
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! ## The `Thread` type
//!
//! Threads are represented via the [`Thread`] type, which you can get in one of
//! two ways:
//!
//! * By spawning a new thread, e.g., using the [`thread::spawn`][`spawn`]
//!   function, and calling [`thread`][`JoinHandle::thread`] on the [`JoinHandle`].
//! * By requesting the current thread, using the [`thread::current`] function.
//!
//! The [`thread::current`] function is available even for threads not spawned
//! by the APIs of this module.
//!
//! ## Thread-local storage
//!
//! This module also provides an implementation of thread-local storage for Rust
//! programs. Thread-local storage is a method of storing data into a global
//! variable that each thread in the program will have its own copy of.
//! Threads do not share this data, so accesses do not need to be synchronized.
//!
//! A thread-local key owns the value it contains and will destroy the value when the
//! thread exits. It is created with the [`thread_local!`] macro and can contain any
//! value that is `'static` (no borrowed pointers). It provides an accessor function,
//! [`with`], that yields a shared reference to the value to the specified
//! closure. Thread-local keys allow only shared access to values, as there would be no
//! way to guarantee uniqueness if mutable borrows were allowed. Most values
//! will want to make use of some form of **interior mutability** through the
//! [`Cell`] or [`RefCell`] types.
//!
//! ## Naming threads
//!
//! Threads are able to have associated names for identification purposes. By default, spawned
//! threads are unnamed. To specify a name for a thread, build the thread with [`Builder`] and pass
//! the desired thread name to [`Builder::name`]. To retrieve the thread name from within the
//! thread, use [`Thread::name`]. A couple examples of where the name of a thread gets used:
//!
//! * If a panic occurs in a named thread, the thread name will be printed in the panic message.
//! * The thread name is provided to the OS where applicable (e.g., `pthread_setname_np` in
//!   unix-like platforms).
//!
//! ## Stack size
//!
//! The default stack size for spawned threads is 2 MiB, though this particular stack size is
//! subject to change in the future. There are two ways to manually specify the stack size for
//! spawned threads:
//!
//! * Build the thread with [`Builder`] and pass the desired stack size to [`Builder::stack_size`].
//! * Set the `RUST_MIN_STACK` environment variable to an integer representing the desired stack
//!   size (in bytes). Note that setting [`Builder::stack_size`] will override this.
//!
//! Note that the stack size of the main thread is *not* determined by Rust.

/// Spawns a new thread, returning a [`JoinHandle`] for it.
///
/// The join handle provides a [`join`] method that can be used to join the spawned
/// thread. If the spawned thread panics, [`join`] will return an [`Err`] containing
/// the argument given to [`panic!`].
///
/// If the join handle is dropped, the spawned thread will implicitly be *detached*.
/// In this case, the spawned thread may no longer be joined.
/// (It is the responsibility of the program to either eventually join threads it
/// creates or detach them; otherwise, a resource leak will result.)
///
/// This call will create a thread using default parameters of [`Builder`], if you
/// want to specify the stack size or the name of the thread, use this API
/// instead.
///
/// As you can see in the signature of `spawn` there are two constraints on
/// both the closure given to `spawn` and its return value, let's explain them:
///
/// - The `'static` constraint means that the closure and its return value
///   must have a lifetime of the whole program execution. The reason for this
///   is that threads can outlive the lifetime they have been created in.
///
///   Indeed if the thread, and by extension its return value, can outlive their
///   caller, we need to make sure that they will be valid afterwards, and since
///   we *can't* know when it will return we need to have them valid as long as
///   possible, that is until the end of the program, hence the `'static`
///   lifetime.
/// - The [`Send`] constraint is because the closure will need to be passed
///   *by value* from the thread where it is spawned to the new thread. Its
///   return value will need to be passed from the new thread to the thread
///   where it is `join`ed.
///   As a reminder, the [`Send`] marker trait expresses that it is safe to be
///   passed from thread to thread. [`Sync`] expresses that it is safe to have a
///   reference be passed from thread to thread.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics if the OS fails to create a thread; use [`Builder::spawn`]
/// to recover from such errors.
///

/// # park and unpark
///
/// Every thread is equipped with some basic low-level blocking support, via the

/// method. [`park`] blocks the current thread, which can then be resumed from
/// another thread by calling the [`unpark`] method on the blocked thread's
/// handle.
///
/// Conceptually, each [`Thread`] handle has an associated token, which is
/// initially not present:
///
/// * The [`thread::park`][`park`] function blocks the current thread unless or
///   until the token is available for its thread handle, at which point it
///   atomically consumes the token. It may also return *spuriously*, without
///   consuming the token. [`thread::park_timeout`] does the same, but allows
///   specifying a maximum time to block the thread for.
///
/// * The [`unpark`] method on a [`Thread`] atomically makes the token available
///   if it wasn't already. Because the token is initially absent, [`unpark`]
///   followed by [`park`] will result in the second call returning immediately.
///
/// In other words, each [`Thread`] acts a bit like a spinlock that can be
/// locked and unlocked using `park` and `unpark`.
///
/// Notice that being unblocked does not imply any synchronization with someone
/// that unparked this thread, it could also be spurious.
/// For example, it would be a valid, but inefficient, implementation to make both [`park`] and
/// [`unpark`] return immediately without doing anything.
///
/// The API is typically used by acquiring a handle to the current thread,
/// placing that handle in a shared data structure so that other threads can
/// find it, and then `park`ing in a loop. When some desired condition is met, another
/// thread calls [`unpark`] on the handle.
///
/// The motivation for this design is twofold:
///
/// * It avoids the need to allocate mutexes and condvars when building new
///   synchronization primitives; the threads already provide basic
///   blocking/signaling.
///
/// * It can be implemented very efficiently on many platforms.

/// Returns an estimate of the default amount of parallelism a program should use.
///
/// Parallelism is a resource. A given machine provides a certain capacity for
/// parallelism, i.e., a bound on the number of computations it can perform
/// simultaneously. This number often corresponds to the amount of CPUs or
/// computer has, but it may diverge in various cases.
///
/// Host environments such as VMs or container orchestrators may want to
/// restrict the amount of parallelism made available to programs in them. This
/// is often done to limit the potential impact of (unintentionally)
/// resource-intensive programs on other programs running on the same machine.
///
/// # Limitations
///
/// The purpose of this API is to provide an easy and portable way to query
/// the default amount of parallelism the program should use. Among other things it
/// does not expose information on NUMA regions, does not account for
/// differences in (co)processor capabilities, and will not modify the program's
/// global state in order to more accurately query the amount of available
/// parallelism.
///
/// Resource limits can be changed during the runtime of a program, therefore the value is
/// not cached and instead recomputed every time this function is called. It should not be
/// called from hot code.
///
/// The value returned by this function should be considered a simplified
/// approximation of the actual amount of parallelism available at any given
/// time. To get a more detailed or precise overview of the amount of
/// parallelism available to the program, you may wish to use
/// platform-specific APIs as well. The following platform limitations currently
/// apply to `available_parallelism`:
///
/// On Windows:
/// - It may undercount the amount of parallelism available on systems with more
///   than 64 logical CPUs. However, programs typically need specific support to
///   take advantage of more than 64 logical CPUs, and in the absence of such
///   support, the number returned by this function accurately reflects the
///   number of logical CPUs the program can use by default.
/// - It may overcount the amount of parallelism available on systems limited by
///   process-wide affinity masks, or job object limitations.
///
/// On Linux:
/// - It may overcount the amount of parallelism available when limited by a
///   process-wide affinity mask, or when affected by cgroup limits.
///
/// On all targets:
/// - It may overcount the amount of parallelism available when running in a VM
/// with CPU usage limits (e.g. an overcommitted host).
///
/// # Errors
///
/// This function will, but is not limited to, return errors in the following
/// cases:
///
/// - If the amount of parallelism is not known for the target platform.
/// - If the program lacks permission to query the amount of parallelism made
///   available to it.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # #![allow(dead_code)]
/// #![feature(available_parallelism)]
/// use std::{io, thread};
///
/// fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
///     let count = thread::available_parallelism()?.get();
///     assert!(count >= 1_usize);
///     Ok(())
/// }
