    /// like `malloc`, accessing environment variables through [`std::env`]
    /// or acquiring a mutex are not guaranteed to work (due to
    /// other threads perhaps still running when the `fork` was run).
    ///
    /// For further details refer to the [POSIX fork() specification]
    /// and the equivalent documentation for any targeted
    /// platform, especially the requirements around *async-signal-safety*.
    ///
    /// This also means that all resources such as file descriptors and
    /// memory-mapped regions got duplicated. It is your responsibility to make
    /// sure that the closure does not violate library invariants by making
    /// invalid use of these duplicates.
    ///
    /// Panicking in the closure is safe only if all the format arguments for the
    /// panic message can be safely formatted; this is because although
    /// `Command` calls [`std::panic::always_abort`](crate::panic::always_abort)
