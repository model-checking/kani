# Platform Support

Support for different platforms ("targets") are organized into three tiers,
each with a different set of guarantees. For more information on the policies
for targets at each tier, see the [Target Tier Policy](target-tier-policy.md).

Targets are identified by their "target triple" which is the string to inform
the compiler what kind of output should be produced.

## Tier 1 with Host Tools

Tier 1 targets can be thought of as "guaranteed to work". The Rust project
builds official binary releases for each tier 1 target, and automated testing
ensures that each tier 1 target builds and passes tests after each change.

Tier 1 targets with host tools additionally support running tools like `rustc`
and `cargo` natively on the target, and automated testing ensures that tests
pass for the host tools as well. This allows the target to be used as a
development platform, not just a compilation target. For the full requirements,
see [Tier 1 with Host Tools](target-tier-policy.md#tier-1-with-host-tools) in
the Target Tier Policy.

All tier 1 targets with host tools support the full standard library.

[^missing-stack-probes]: Stack probes support is missing on
  `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`, but it's planned to be implemented in the near
  future. The implementation is tracked on [issue #77071][77071].

## Tier 1

Tier 1 targets can be thought of as "guaranteed to work". The Rust project
builds official binary releases for each tier 1 target, and automated testing
ensures that each tier 1 target builds and passes tests after each change. For
the full requirements, see [Tier 1 target
policy](target-tier-policy.md#tier-1-target-policy) in the Target Tier Policy.

At this time, all Tier 1 targets are [Tier 1 with Host
Tools](#tier-1-with-host-tools).

## Tier 2 with Host Tools

Tier 2 targets can be thought of as "guaranteed to build". The Rust project
builds official binary releases for each tier 2 target, and automated builds
ensure that each tier 2 target builds after each change. Automated tests are
not always run so it's not guaranteed to produce a working build, but tier 2
targets often work to quite a good degree and patches are always welcome!

Tier 2 targets with host tools additionally support running tools like `rustc`
and `cargo` natively on the target, and automated builds ensure that the host
tools build as well. This allows the target to be used as a development
platform, not just a compilation target. For the full requirements, see [Tier 2
with Host Tools](target-tier-policy.md#tier-2-with-host-tools) in the Target
Tier Policy.

All tier 2 targets with host tools support the full standard library.

**NOTE:** Tier 2 targets currently do not build the `rust-docs` component.

## Tier 2

Tier 2 targets can be thought of as "guaranteed to build". The Rust project
builds official binary releases for each tier 2 target, and automated builds
ensure that each tier 2 target builds after each change. Automated tests are
not always run so it's not guaranteed to produce a working build, but tier 2
targets often work to quite a good degree and patches are always welcome! For
the full requirements, see [Tier 2 target
policy](target-tier-policy.md#tier-2-target-policy) in the Target Tier Policy.

The `std` column in the table below has the following meanings:

* ✓ indicates the full standard library is available.
* \* indicates the target only supports [`no_std`] development.

[`no_std`]: https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/intro/no-std.html

**NOTE:** Tier 2 targets currently do not build the `rust-docs` component.

## Tier 3

Tier 3 targets are those which the Rust codebase has support for, but which the
Rust project does not build or test automatically, so they may or may not work.
Official builds are not available. For the full requirements, see [Tier 3
target policy](target-tier-policy.md#tier-3-target-policy) in the Target Tier
Policy.

The `std` column in the table below has the following meanings:

* ✓ indicates the full standard library is available.
* \* indicates the target only supports [`no_std`] development.
* ? indicates the standard library support is unknown or a work-in-progress.

[`no_std`]: https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/intro/no-std.html

The `host` column indicates whether the codebase includes support for building
host tools.
