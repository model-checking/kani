   = help: the trait `Sync` is not implemented for `RefCell<isize>`
   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `Sync` for `Unique<RefCell<isize>>`
   = note: required because it appears within the type `Box<RefCell<isize>>`
   = note: shared static variables must have a type that implements `Sync`
