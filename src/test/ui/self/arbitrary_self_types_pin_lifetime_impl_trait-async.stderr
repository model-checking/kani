error[E0700]: hidden type for `impl Trait` captures lifetime that does not appear in bounds
  --> $DIR/arbitrary_self_types_pin_lifetime_impl_trait-async.rs:8:37

LL |     async fn f(self: Pin<&Self>) -> impl Clone { self }
   |                          -          ^^^^^^^^^^

   |                          hidden type `Pin<&Foo>` captures the lifetime `'_` as defined here
   |
help: to declare that the `impl Trait` captures `'_`, you can add an explicit `'_` lifetime bound

LL |     async fn f(self: Pin<&Self>) -> impl Clone + '_ { self }
