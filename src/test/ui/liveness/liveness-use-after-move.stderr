error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `x`
  --> $DIR/liveness-use-after-move.rs:6:20

   |         - move occurs because `x` has type `Box<i32>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     let y = x;
   |             - value moved here
LL | 
LL |     println!("{}", *x);
   |                    ^^ value borrowed here after move
