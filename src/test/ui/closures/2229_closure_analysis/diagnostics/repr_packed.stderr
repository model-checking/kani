   = note: `#[warn(unaligned_references)]` on by default
   = warning: this was previously accepted by the compiler but is being phased out; it will become a hard error in a future release!
   = note: for more information, see issue #82523 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82523>
   = note: fields of packed structs are not properly aligned, and creating a misaligned reference is undefined behavior (even if that reference is never dereferenced)
   = help: copy the field contents to a local variable, or replace the reference with a raw pointer and use `read_unaligned`/`write_unaligned` (loads and stores via `*p` must be properly aligned even when using raw pointers)
   = note: this warning originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
