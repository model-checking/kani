error[E0119]: conflicting implementations of trait `complex_impl_support::External` for type `(Q, complex_impl_support::M<'_, '_, '_, std::boxed::Box<_>, _, _>)`

error[E0117]: only traits defined in the current crate can be implemented for arbitrary types
  --> $DIR/complex-impl.rs:9:1

LL | impl<R> External for (Q, R) {}
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^------
   | |                    |
   | |                    this is not defined in the current crate because tuples are always foreign
   | impl doesn't use only types from inside the current crate
   |
   = note: define and implement a trait or new type instead
