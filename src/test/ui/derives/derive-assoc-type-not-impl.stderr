error[E0599]: the method `clone` exists for struct `Bar<NotClone>`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied

   |                              ^^^^^ method cannot be called on `Bar<NotClone>` due to unsatisfied trait bounds
   |
   = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `NotClone: Clone`
           which is required by `Bar<NotClone>: Clone`
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `clone`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `Clone`
help: consider annotating `NotClone` with `#[derive(Clone)]`

LL | #[derive(Clone)]
