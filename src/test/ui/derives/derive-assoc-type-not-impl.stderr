error[E0599]: the method `clone` exists for struct `Bar<NotClone>`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied

LL | struct Bar<T: Foo> {
   | ------------------

   | method `clone` not found for this
   | doesn't satisfy `Bar<NotClone>: Clone`

   |
note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied because of the requirements of the implementation of `Clone` for `_`:
      `NotClone: Clone`
  --> $DIR/derive-assoc-type-not-impl.rs:6:10

LL | #[derive(Clone)]
   |          ^^^^^
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `clone`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `Clone`
   = note: this error originates in the derive macro `Clone` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider annotating `NotClone` with `#[derive(Clone)]`

LL | #[derive(Clone)]
