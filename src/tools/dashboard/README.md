# Confidence Dashboard

This tool generates a dashboard of the Rust features supported by RMC. It
does so by extracting examples from Rust books, running RMC on them, and
displaying the results in the dashboard.

Run the following command to build this tool and generate the dashboard:
```bash
./x.py run -i --stage 1 dashboard
```
