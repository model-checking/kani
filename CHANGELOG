# Changelog

This file contains notable changes (e.g. breaking changes, major changes, etc.) in Kani releases.

This file was introduced starting Kani 0.23.0, so it only contains changes from version 0.23.0 onwards.

## [0.23.0]

### **Breaking Changes**

- The second parameter in the `kani::any_where` function (`_msg: &'static str`) was removed to make the function more ergonomic to use.
We suggest moving the explanation for why the assumption is introduced into a comment.
For example, the following code:
```rust
    let len: usize = kani::any_where(|x| *x < 5, "Restrict the length to a value less than 5");
```
should be replaced by:
```rust
    // Restrict the length to a value less than 5
    let len: usize = kani::any_where(|x| *x < 5);
```
