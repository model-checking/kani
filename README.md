# Rust Model Checker (RMC)
The Rust Model Checker (RMC) aims to be a bit-precise model-checker for Rust.

## Project Status
RMC is currently in the initial development phase.
It **does not yet support all Rust language features**.
We are working to extend our support of language features.
If you encounter issues when using RMC we encourage you to 
[report them to us](https://github.com/model-checking/rmc/issues/new/choose).

## Quickstart

1. Install the dependencies needed for [`rustc`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust),
   [CBMC](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc) and
   [CBMC Viewer](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-viewer-for-cbmc/releases/latest).

   The [RMC Installation Guide](https://model-checking.github.io/rmc/install-guide.html)
   shows how to quickly install them using our setup scripts.

1. Configure RMC. 
   We recommend using the following options:
   ```
   ./configure \
      --enable-debug \
      --set=llvm.download-ci-llvm=true \
      --set=rust.debug-assertions-std=false \
      --set=rust.deny-warnings=false
   ```

1. Build RMC
   ```
   ./x.py build -i --stage 1 library/std
   ```

1. Run the RMC test-suite
   ```
   ./scripts/rmc-regression.sh
   ```

## Running RMC
RMC currently supports command-line invocation on single files.
We are actively working to integrate RMC into `cargo` (see [experimental Cargo integration](#experimental-cargo-integration)).
Until then, the easiest way to use RMC is as follows


1. Add `rmc/scripts` to your path
1. Go to a folder that contains a rust file you would like to verify with RMC.
   For example, `cd rmc/src/test/rmc/Parenths`.
   By default, `rmc` uses `main()` as the entry point.
1. Execute RMC on the file
   ```
   rmc main.rs
   ```
   You should see output that looks like the following
   ```
      ** Results:
   main.rs function main
   [main.assertion.1] line 7 attempt to compute `move _6 + const 1_i32`, which would overflow: SUCCESS
   [main.assertion.2] line 7 attempt to compute `move _4 * move _5`, which would overflow: SUCCESS
   [main.assertion.3] line 8 assertion failed: c == 88: SUCCESS
   [main.assertion.4] line 11 attempt to compute `move _16 * move _17`, which would overflow: SUCCESS
   [main.assertion.5] line 11 attempt to compute `move _15 + const 1_i32`, which would overflow: SUCCESS
   [main.assertion.6] line 11 attempt to compute `move _14 * move _20`, which would overflow: SUCCESS
   [main.assertion.7] line 12 assertion failed: e == 10 * (500 + 5): SUCCESS
   ```
1. Write your own test file, add your own assertions, and try it out!

### Using your Config.toml to configure RMC

When invoking RMC using `cargo rmc`, you can use your Config.toml to configure the flags for RMC.
If you want to configure your project to use the following command:

`cargo rmc --c-lib src/lib/harness.c src/lib/api.c src/lib/utils.c --function test_all_rmc --no-memory-safety-checks --verbose --target-dir dev/target --visualize`

Then you could put the following into your Cargo.toml:

```
...
[rmc.flags]
c-lib = [
   "src/lib/harness.c",
   "src/lib/api.c"
   "src/lib/utils.c"
]
function = "test_all_rmc"
memory-safety-checks = false
verbose = true
target-dir = "dev/target"
visualize = true
...
```
and invoke RMC with `cargo rmc /path/to/project`.

You can additionally specify a different toml file to use with the `--config-toml` or disable this feature with `--no-config-toml`.

Lastly, you can override specific flags from command line, e.g. with `cargo rmc /path/to/project --function test_different_rmc`.

### Advanced flags
RMC supports a set of advanced flags that give you control over the verification process.
For example, consider the `CopyIntrinsics` regression test:
1. `cd rmc/src/test/rmc/CopyIntrinsics`
1. Execute RMC on the file
   `rmc main.rs`
1. Note that this will unwind forever
   ```
   Unwinding loop memcmp.0 iteration 1 file <builtin-library-memcmp> line 25 function memcmp thread 0
   Unwinding loop memcmp.0 iteration 2 file <builtin-library-memcmp> line 25 function memcmp thread 0
   Unwinding loop memcmp.0 iteration 3 file <builtin-library-memcmp> line 25 function memcmp thread 0
   Unwinding loop memcmp.0 iteration 4 file <builtin-library-memcmp> line 25 function memcmp thread 0
   Unwinding loop memcmp.0 iteration 5 file <builtin-library-memcmp> line 25 function memcmp thread 0
   ...
   ```
1. You can pass additional arguments to the CBMC backend using the syntax:
   ```
   rmc filename.rs --cbmc-args <additional CBMC arguments>
   ```
   To see which arguments CBMC supports, run `cbmc --help`.
   In this case, we want the `--unwind` argument to limit the unwinding.
   We also use the `--unwinding-assertions` argument to ensure that our unwind bounds are sufficient.
   Note that:
   ```
   rmc main.rs --cbmc-args --unwind 1 --unwinding-assertions
   ```
   produces an unwinding failure, while
   ```
   rmc main.rs --cbmc-args --unwind 17 --unwinding-assertions
   ```
   leads to all assertions passing.
1. You can check for undefined behaviour using builtin checks from CBMC.
   Try using `--pointer-check`, or `--unsigned-overflow-check`.
   You can see the full list of available checks by running `cbmc --help`.

### Looking under the hood
1. To see "under the hood" of what RMC is doing, try passing the `--gen-c` flag to RMC
   ```
   rmc --gen-c main.rs <other-args>
   ```
   This generates a file `main.c` which contains a "C" like formatting of the CBMC IR.
1. The `--gen-c` flag does not produce runnable C code due to differences in the Rust and C languages.
   To produce a runnable C program, try passing the `--gen-c-runnable` flag to RMC
   ```
   rmc --gen-c-runnable main.rs <other-args>
   ```
   This generates a file `main_runnable.c`. 
   Note that this makes some compromises to produce runnable C code, so you should not expect exact semantic equivalence.
1. You can also view the raw CBMC internal representation using the `--keep-temps` option.

### Experimental Cargo integration

We are actively working to improve RMC's integration with Rust's Cargo package and build system. Currently, you can build projects with Cargo via a multi-step process.

For example, we will describe using RMC as a backend to build the [`rand-core` crate](https://crates.io/crates/rand_core). These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu Linux with the `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` target.

1. Build RMC
   ```
   ./x.py build -i --stage 1 library/std
   ```

2. Clone `rand` and navigate to the `rand-core` directory:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:rust-random/rand.git
   cd rand/rand_core
   ```
3. Next, we need to add an entry-point for CBMC to the crate's source. For now, we will just pick an existing unit test. Open `src/le.rs` and find the `test_read` function at the bottom of the file. Add the following attribute to keep the function name unmangled, so we can later pass it to CBMC. 

   ```rust
   // #[test]      <- Remove/comment out this
   #[no_mangle] // <- Add this
   fn test_read() {
      let bytes = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16];

      let mut buf = [0u32; 4];
      read_u32_into(&bytes, &mut buf);
      assert_eq!(buf[0], 0x04030201);
      assert_eq!(buf[3], 0x100F0E0D);
      // ...
   }
   ```

4. Now, we can run Cargo and specify that RMC should be the backend. We also pass a location for the build artifacts (`rand-core-demo`) and a target (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`). 
   ```
    CARGO_TARGET_DIR=rand-core-demo RUST_BACKTRACE=1 RUSTFLAGS="-Z codegen-backend=gotoc --cfg=rmc" RUSTC=rmc-rustc cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
   ```

5. Now, navigate to the output directory for the given target. 
   ```
    cd rand-core-demo/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/deps/
   ```
   
6. The output of Cargo with RMC is a series of JSON files that define CMBC symbols. We now can use CBMC commands to convert and link these files:
   ```
   symtab2gb rand_core-*.json --out a.out              // Convert from JSON to Gotoc 
   goto-cc --function test_read a.out -o a.out         // Add the entry point we previously selected
   goto-instrument --drop-unused-functions a.out a.out // Remove unused functions
   cbmc a.out                                          // Run CBMC
   ```

You should then see verification succeed:
```
** 0 of 43 failed (1 iterations)
VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL
```

To sanity-check that verification is working, try changing ` assert_eq!(buf[0], 0x04030201);` to a different value and rerun these commands.

For crates with multiple JSON files in the `deps` folder, we suggest running the first command in this step with [`parallel`](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/):
   ```
   ls *.json | parallel -j 16 symtab2gb {} --out {.}.out // Convert from JSON to Gotoc 
   ```
