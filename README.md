# Rust Model Checker (RMC)
The Rust Model Checker (RMC) aims to be a bit-precise model-checker for Rust.

## Project Status
RMC is currently in the initial development phase.
It **does not yet support all rust language features**.
We are working to extend our support of language features.
If you encounter issues when using RMC we encourage you to 
[report them to us](https://github.com/model-checking/rmc/issues/new/choose).

## Quickstart

1. Install all dependencies required for upstream-rust, as per the 
   [README](UPSTREAM-README.md#building-on-a-unix-like-system).

1. Install CBMC.
   CBMC has prebuilt releases 
   [available for major platforms](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc/releases).
   RMC currently works with CBMC versions 5.26 or greater.
   If you want to build CBMC from source, follow 
   [the cmake instructions from the CBMC repo](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc/blob/develop/COMPILING.md#working-with-cmake).
   We recommend using `ninja` as the CBMC build system.

1. Configure RMC. 
   We recommend using the following options:
   ```
   ./configure \
      --debuginfo-level-rustc=2 \
      --enable-debug \
      --set=llvm.download-ci-llvm=true \
      --set=rust.debug-assertions-std=false \
      --set=rust.deny-warnings=false \
      --set=rust.incremental=true
   ```

1. Build RMC
   ```
   ./x.py build -i --stage 1 library/std
   ```

1. Run the RMC test-suite
   ```
   ./scripts/rmc-regression.sh
   ```

## Running RMC
RMC currently supports command-line invocation on single files.
We are actively working to integrate RMC into `cargo`.
Until then, the easiest way to use RMC is as follows


1. Add `rmc/scripts` to your path
1. Go to a folder that contains a rust file you would like to verify with RMC.
   For example, `cd rmc/rust-tests/cbmc-reg/Parenths`.
   By default, `rmc` uses `main()` as the entry point.
1. Execute RMC on the file
   ```
   rmc main.rs
   ```
   You should see output that looks like the following
   ```
      ** Results:
   main.rs function main
   [main.assertion.1] line 7 attempt to compute `move _6 + const 1_i32`, which would overflow: SUCCESS
   [main.assertion.2] line 7 attempt to compute `move _4 * move _5`, which would overflow: SUCCESS
   [main.assertion.3] line 8 assertion failed: c == 88: SUCCESS
   [main.assertion.4] line 11 attempt to compute `move _16 * move _17`, which would overflow: SUCCESS
   [main.assertion.5] line 11 attempt to compute `move _15 + const 1_i32`, which would overflow: SUCCESS
   [main.assertion.6] line 11 attempt to compute `move _14 * move _20`, which would overflow: SUCCESS
   [main.assertion.7] line 12 assertion failed: e == 10 * (500 + 5): SUCCESS
   ```
1. Write your own test file, add your own assertions, and try it out!

### Advanced flags
RMC supports a set of advanced flags that give you control over the verification process.
For example, consider the `CopyIntrinsics` regression test:
1. `cd rmc/rust-tests/cbmc-reg/CopyIntrinsics`
1. Execute RMC on the file
   `rmc main.rs`
1. Note that this will unwind forever
   ```
   Unwinding loop memcmp.0 iteration 1 file <builtin-library-memcmp> line 25 function memcmp thread 0
   Unwinding loop memcmp.0 iteration 2 file <builtin-library-memcmp> line 25 function memcmp thread 0
   Unwinding loop memcmp.0 iteration 3 file <builtin-library-memcmp> line 25 function memcmp thread 0
   Unwinding loop memcmp.0 iteration 4 file <builtin-library-memcmp> line 25 function memcmp thread 0
   Unwinding loop memcmp.0 iteration 5 file <builtin-library-memcmp> line 25 function memcmp thread 0
   ...
   ```
1. You can pass additional arguments to the CBMC backend using the syntax:
   ```
   rmc filename.rs -- <additional CBMC arguments>
   ```
   To see which arguments CBMC supports, run `cbmc --help`.
   In this case, we want the `--unwind` argument to limit the unwinding.
   We also use the `--unwinding-assertions` argument to ensure that our unwind bounds are sufficient.
   Note that:
   ```
   rmc main.rs -- --unwind 1 --unwinding-assertions
   ```
   produces an unwinding failure, while
   ```
   rmc main.rs -- --unwind 17 --unwinding-assertions
   ```
   leads to all assertions passing.
1. You can check for undefined behaviour using builtin checks from CBMC.
   Try using `--pointer-check`, or `--unsigned-overflow-check`.
   You can see the full list of available checks by running `cbmc --help`.

### Looking under the hood
1. To see "under the hood" of what RMC is doing, try passing the `--gen-c` flag to RMC
   ```
   rmc --gen-c main.rs <other-args>
   ```
   This generates a file `main.c` which contains a "C" like formatting of the CBMC IR.
1. You can also view the raw CBMC internal representation using the `--keep-temps` option.
