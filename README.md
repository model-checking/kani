# Kani Rust Verifier

The Kani Rust Verifier is a bit-precise model checker for Rust.

Kani verifies:
 * memory safety -- even in unsafe Rust code
 * user-specified assertions
 * absence of panics
 * checks for some classes of undefined behavior

## Installation

Kani must currently be built from source. See [the installation guide](https://model-checking.github.io/kani/install-guide.html) for more details.

## How does Kani work?

You write a _proof harness_ that looks a lot like a test harness, except that you can check all possible values using `kani::any()`:

```rust
use my_crate::{function_under_test, is_valid, meets_specification};

#[kani::proof]
fn check_my_property() {
   // Create a nondeterministic input
   let input = kani::any();
   // Constrain it to represent valid values
   kani::assume(is_valid(input));
   // Call the function under verification
   let output = function_under_test(input);
   // Check that it meets the specification
   assert!(meets_specification(input, output));
}
```

Kani will then prove that all valid inputs produce acceptable outputs, without panicking or executing undefined behavior.
We recommend following [the tutorial](https://model-checking.github.io/kani/kani-tutorial.html) to learn more about how to use Kani.
