This is a temporary wrapper that can be used to compiler rust into gotoc. This
binary should not be used on its own and it should be used via `kani` or
`cargo-kani` commands.

### Notes for developers:

This binary can be built like a regular cargo package. There is no need to
bootstrap it anymore.
